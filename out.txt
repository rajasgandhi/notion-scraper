Add and manage integrations
Note:On Enterprise Plans, the following can be restricted to workspace owners:
The ability toadd connections
The ability toinstall workspace-wide security and compliance integrations
Members can add connections to a workspace inSettings & members→My connections. Workspace owners can add connections to a workspace inSettings & members→Connections. Once a connection is added, it can be added to more pages.
Connections built with the API follow a similar permission system to the sharing permissions for Notion users. In order to use a connection in your workspace, you'll need to add it to the specific page where it will be active.
Navigate to a page and select•••at the top right.
----
At the bottom of the pop-up, clickAdd connections.
In the resulting pop-up, search for and select the connection you would like to add to this page. You'll only see connections that have been created for and associated with this workspace.
The connection will now appear in the•••menu for the page.
If you want to remove a connection from a page, hover over its name and then pressDisconnect.
Note:Workspace owners manage all connections in a workspace. For more info,click here.
In your left sidebar, navigate toSettings & membersand then theConnectionstab.
Here, you'll see two tabs,MembersandWorkspaces.
----
From theMemberstab, you can manage the integrations that members can access in the workspace. Specifically, you can limit integration access to an approved list of integrations, view who is using an internal integration and disconnect the use of any integration in the workspace.
Note: Only Enterprise Workspace Owners can limit integration access to an approved list of integrations.
From theWorkspacestab, you can install and manage Security & Compliance integrations for their entire Enterprise workspace.
Click the•••next to an connection to see additional options:
Retrieve an internal API token
Visit the developer's website or contact their support
View users with access to the connection
Disconnect the connection
----
Notion has partnered directly with several services (such asZapierandTypeform). You can add our partners' public connections to your workspace directly through their sites via OAuth.
Search forNotionin the partner platform's app menu and add it.
In the resulting authentication menu, you'll be asked by the partner connection to allow access your workspace. The access levels required by the connection will be specified.
Connections are workspace-specific! Click the workspace name at the top right to switch to another workspace if needed. Then, pressSelect pages.
Now, you'll see a list of all of the pages in the selected workspace. Choose the pages you would like the connection to be able to access, and then pressAllow access.
----
Once you've completed the authentication, you'll see this connection in your workspace'sSettings & membersmenu →Connections.
Click the•••menu next to the connection name to visit the developer's website, contact the developer's support team, or disconnect the connection from your workspace.
Tip:Want to see some partner integrations in action?Check out this guide →
Some partner platforms require an internal integration token in order to link to your workspace.
In this case, first follow these instructions to create a corresponding internal integration for your workspace.
Once you've created the internal integration, navigate toSettings & membersin your sidebar and then theConnectionstab.
----
Click the•••menu next to the existing connection that you'd like to link to a partner platform, and pressCopy internal integration token.
Paste this internal integration token into the corresponding field on the partner platform's set up form.
Note:Notion does not support troubleshooting for partner integrations. Please direct any feedback and questions to the respective partner's support team.
With Notion's API, you'll be able to create custom internal integrations. Some of our partners may also require an internal integration token in order to link their platform to your Notion workspace - below, we'll walk you through how to set this up 🏗️

Notion pricing
Billing, payment, and refunds
There are several ways users can interact with a Notion workspace:
Members:People in your company or organization who can create and edit Notion pages, but can’t change any settings. These are colleagues or people who you work with across a large portion of your workspace.
----
Guests:People external to your company or organization who can be invited to individual Notion pages, but not an entire workspace. These are people who aren’t part of your team that you may want to work on specific pages with.
Workspace owners:Admins who can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage other workspace owners, admins, members, and guests.
Membership admins (Enterprise plan only):People who can add or remove members from workspaces or groups. They don’t have access to workspace settings.
----
Note: Depending on how your workspace owner has adjusted your workspace’s security settings, members may or may not by able to request adding guests or members. Additionally, users may or may not be able to request to be added to a workspace as a member.
Members are individualsin your company or organization. These could be colleagues at the same organization or people who read, edit, and comment on a lot of the same pages in a workspace.
To manage your workspace members, go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan). Here, you’ll see:
A list of active members of your workspace.
What teamspaces and groups they belong to.
Each member’s role in the workspace.
----
Note:On paid plans, you'll be charged per member in your workspace. For more information on plans,go here →
With email
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
Go to theMemberstab.
SelectAdd membersand type the email address of the person you want to add. If you don't have invite access, you will instead have the option to request to add a member.
Select whether to add them as aWorkspace owner,Membership admin, orMemberfrom the dropdown, then pressInvite.
They'll receive an email with a link to sign in and join your workspace.
Using a link
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
Go to theMemberstab.
----
SelectCopy linkto copy the secret link to your clipboard, and share with anyone you’d like to invite to work with you.
When an invited user clicks on the secret link, they'll be able to join your workspace automatically as a paid member, without you having to add their email address manually.
If you don’t want to be able to invite people to your workspace with a link, turn off the toggle next toInvite link.
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
Go to theMemberstab.
Select the dropdown for a member’s role, then selectWorkspace owner,Membership admin, orMember.
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
Go to theMemberstab.
Depending on your plan:
----
Select the dropdown for a member’s role, then selectRemove from workspace.
Select•••next to a member, then selectRemove from workspace.
Workspace owners can also remove other workspace owners from the workspace.
Note:
When you remove a member from a workspace, that person will instantly lose access to the workspace, and pages from thePrivatesection of their left sidebar will be hidden from view. If you invite that member back to the workspace, their private pages will be unhidden.
If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership will be restored upon rejoining the workspace.
----
If you're using Notion at your company, you can make it easy for anyone to automatically join your workspace as a member when they sign in with their work email.
Go toSettings & members→Settings.
UnderAllowed email domains, enter any email domain that you want to grant access to automatically, like your company's email domain. You can add multiple allowed domains in this field, but you'll only be able to add domains that workspace members' accounts are under.
Now, whenever someone signs into Notion with an email that has one of those domains, they'll see the option to join your workspace during onboarding. If the user joins your workspace, they will become a member of your workspace and you will be billed accordingly.
----
Note:Unlike members,guests are free to invite to your workspace as long as you stay withinyour plan’s guest limit. If your workspace is above this limit, any new users that you share content with will be automatically added as members and not guests if they have the same organization email domain.
To ensure you’re adding users as guests and not members, you’ll need to remove existing guests so you’re below your limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers).
Guests are individualsexternal to your company or organizationwho you invite into your workspace on a page-by-page basis. For example, guests could be:
People who have a different organization email domain.
----
Contractors or interns who are working with you temporarily.
Clients who you want to provide feedback on your work.
Friends, family, or mentors that you want to have contribute to or review your work.
Guests have the same capabilities as members, except:
They can't be given workspace-wide access. They must be invited to individual pages in order to view them and their sub-pages.
They can't create new pages outside of the ones they have access to.
They can't be added to groups of members.
They can't adjust workspace settings or billing information.
They can't add new members to your workspace.
They can't add new integrations to your workspace.
On any page you want to share with a guest:
Go toShareat the top right.
----
Enter the email address of any guest you want to invite.
Select a level of access for that guest from the dropdown and pressInvite.
SelectSkip for nowto make sure you’re adding them as a guest and not a member.
They'll receive an email with a link to the page.
If they don't already use Notion, they can sign up to access your page.
Note:If you’re on an Enterprise plan and the owner has prevented members from inviting guests to pages, then any people you invite to a page will automatically be added as members. Before you selectInvitein the steps above, you can hover over your guest’s name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.
Allow and approve access requests from guests
----
To make it easier for you to add guests to your workspace, Notion also allows people outside of your workspace to request access to certain pages in your workspace. This feature is available and turned on by default for all plans except Enterprise.
If you’re on a Personal Pro, Plus, or Business plan and you want to turn this setting off:
OpenSettings & members→Security.
Toggle offAllow page access requests from non-members.
Free plans will not be able to turn this feature off.
Once the guest submits a request to access a page, a notification will be sent to the inbox of the page’s creator. The page creator can approve the request as well as adjust the level of access for that guest, or they can ignore the request.
----
Note:When you add someone to a page, they can automatically access all of its sub-pages by default. That being said, you can restrict or expand sub-page permissions!
Members of a workspace can request to add guests to it. This feature is available on Enterprise plans only, and only workspace owners can enable or disable it.
Enable guest requests
Go toSettings & members→Security.
Make sureDisable members inviting guests to pagesis turned on, then turn onAllow members to request adding guests. Workspace owners canDisable guestswithout removing existing guests from the workspace. They still have the option to remove all existing guests if desired.
----
Once this is turned on, members will have to submit a request before they can invite a guest. Workspace owners are exempt and can continue to invite guests directly.
Note:Allow members to request adding guestsis a workspace level setting, and will override the any teamspace level guest setting. This means if a teamspace allows guests, but the workspace has enabled guest requests, members will have to submit guest invite requests to add guests to pages in the teamspace.
Request to invite a guest
If you're a workspace owner,you caninvite guests directly.
If you're a member:
Navigate to the page you want to invite a guest to. Just like with regular sharing, you must have full access permissions on the page to request to invite a guest.
----
SelectShareand type the name of the guest you want to invite.
Select the role you want the guest to have.
SelectInvite.
A notification will be sent to your workspace owner about your request, along with the page, role and email of the guest you requested. You will also receive confirmation that your workspace owner has been notified.
Approve a guest
Guest invite requests must be approved on a per page, per guest basis.Only workspace owners can view and approve guest requests. Each request will have the email of the guest, the member who requested it, the role that was requested, and the name of the page.
----
A workspace owner can approve or reject a request to invite a guest directly from the notification they receive, or by going to by going toSettings & members→Members→Guestsand finding the requests at the top. Once a workspace owner responds to a request, the member who submitted will be notified of the decision.
Once you've added a guest to a page, you can always change their level of access later. To change a guest's access level:
Go toShareat the top right. You'll see the page's guests listed in the dropdown menu.
Click the menu to the right of a guest's name. Choose which level of access you want to grant that guest from the following options:
Full access:They can edit and share the page.
----
Can edit:They can edit the page's content, but they can't share the page. (This is not available for guests on the Free plan.)
Can edit content:This permission level is only found ondatabase pages. They can create and edit pages within the database. They can't change the structure of the database and its properties, views, sorts or filters.Learn more about databases here →
Can comment:They can only read and comment, not edit or share.
Can view:They can only view the content, and can't share it.
Remove:Revokes their access to the page.
You can see a list of all the guests in your workspace and the pages they each have access by going toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Guests.
----
Under your list of workspace members, find your list of guests.
To the right, you'll see how many pages each guest has been invited to. Click to see or hop to the pages they can access.
On any of these pages, you can edit their level of access or remove them.
Give any guest the ability to access your entire workspace by turning them into a member. On paid plans, you'll be charged for each additional member. To turn a guest into a member:
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Guests.
Check the box next to the guests you want to upgrade.
SelectUpgrade {#} guest(s) to member.
Once they become a member, you can find them in your member list and change their role.
----
On non-Enterprise plans, we’ll also suggest some guests who might benefit from becoming members in your workspace. To see who these guests are, go toSettings & members→Members→Suggestions. You can selectUpgradeto turn someone into a workspace member.
To remove a guest from your workspace:
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Guests.
Check the box next to the guests you want to remove from your workspace.
SelectRemove from workspace.
To remove a guest from specific pages, you’ll have to go to theSharemenu in each page andRemovethem there.
----
You can set varying and granular permissions for different groups and teams without having to divide your people into different workspaces! Instead, create groups inside one workspace and grant them different levels of access page by page. Here's how.
Note:Guests in your workspace can't be added to groups. This feature is for members only!
Workspace owners and membership admins can create and edit groups. To do this:
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Groups.
SelectCreate a groupand enter a name for your group. To set an icon for the group, just click the emoji icon that appears on hover.
Toggle open your new group and selectAdd members.
Add as many members as you want to any group.
----
You can also clickRemoveto the right of any group member.
Select•••next to a group toRenameit,Create teamspace from group, orDeleteit.
You can always search someone's name or email to see which group they're in.
For any page, choose which groups can read, comment, edit, and share it. To share a page with a group:
ClickShare, thenInvite. You'll see all groups at the bottom of the pop-up.
Pick a group, then choose what type of access you'd like to give that group from the dropdown:
Full access:They can edit and share the page.

Can comment:They can only read and comment, not edit or share.
----
Can view:They can only read the content, and can't share it.
Remove:Revokes their access to the page.
Once a group has been added, you'll see it in theSharemenu, and you can adjust their access level in the drop-down.
You can give multiple groups access at any level on the same page.
Permissions on any page also apply to all of their sub-pages.
Teamspaces are a dedicated area for every team within your organization or company, and can be customized on an individual basis.Learn more about teamspaces →
To share a teamspace with groups in your workspace:
Hover over the name of the teamspace in your sidebar.
Click the•••button, thenTeamspace settings.
From here, you'll be able to search and add groups to the teamspace.
----
Is there a limit to how many guests I can add?
See the guest limit for your planhere →
If your workspace is above the guest limit for yourplan,new users that you share content with can only be added as a member (instead of as a guest) if they belong to your workspace's email domains. This could mean that they have anallowed email domainor an email domain matching the workspace owner’s domain or one of the workspace’sverified domains.
I clicked the Join or create workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?
----
You can only join a workspace via theJoin or create workspacebutton if that workspace has theAllowed Email Domainssetting enabled to allow users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.
Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.
How do I share with individuals and not whole groups?
You can share a private page with individual members of your workspace by clickingShareat the top right and thenInvite a Person. Search for their name, set a level of access for them and pressInvite.
You can also share a private page with a guest through the same mechanism, only you should type their email instead of searching their name and pressInvite.
Why do I need to disable workspace-level access?
----
You don't have to. Just know that whatever level of access is specified forEveryone at [workspace]is the lowest level of access for everyone in your workspace. If you want some pages to not be visible to certain people, then we recommend disabling it. You can always grant some groups or individuals more access.
Why are these pages in the Shared section of my left-hand sidebar?
Those are pages shared with only specific groups or individuals. They aren't visible to the rest of the people in your workspace. In order for pages shared with groups to show up in this part of your sidebar, you need to disableEveryone at [workspace]. Otherwise, everyone in your workspace will still see it.
----
As a quick refresher, any page in theWorkspacesection of your sidebar can be viewed in some respect by everyone in your workspace. Any page in thePrivatesection of your sidebar is for your eyes only.
How can groups be used instead of multiple separate workspaces?
We've seen people create multiple workspaces instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, and their executive team so these groups can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. There's a quick workaround for this using groups:
DisableWorkspace access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.
----
On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.
So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn onFull accessfor only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!
Can I create a shared private page using groups?
----
Yes. If you create a page in thePrivatesection of your sidebar, you can go toShareand toggle on access for a group inside your workspace. Choose their access level like you would on any other page. You'll see the page automatically move to theSharedsection of your sidebar. Only you and the members of that group will be able to see it.
How can I allow members in my workspace to request guests for approval?
As a workspace owner, you can disable guests for your workspace in yourworkspace security settings, but still allow members to send guest invite requests for review by the workspace owners. This provides a standardized way for guests to get access to content within your workspace, without being an all or nothing approach.
----
There's no limit on the number of people who can view and edit the same page or database at the same time. Your team can collaborate on shared content no matter where they are, what time it is, or what device they're using 💼

I just made updates to a page, but I didn't receive a Slack notification.
There's a five minute delay built in to prevent these notifications from getting too noisy!Let us knowif you still aren't seeing them show up! We'll help out.
I'm trying to enable the integration in Slack's App Directory, but it just takes me to Notion's homepage.
----
Sorry for the confusion 🙈You can't enable the integration from Slack. You'll need to turn it on inside Notion with the instructions on this page.
What permissions are granted when the Slack integration is enabled?
Notion's integration with Slack operates on a per-page basis. When you enable the Slack integration for a specific page in your Notion workspace, you're granting Notion access to publish updates to the Slack channel of your choosing.
Can I add more than one login for a link preview integration?
You can! You can do so viaSettings & Members→My connected apps. For the desired integration, select “Connect another account”.
----
Note: Some applications do not support multi-account login in the browser (e.g. GitHub), so you might need to logout of whichever account is currently logged in on your browser to be prompted to login with a different account.
We’ll determine which of your accounts to use to preview given resources and show an error if none of them are successful.
I’m receiving a general  “Can’t load preview” error in my link preview.
Run through these steps to try to resolve.
Confirm you’ve authenticated with the correct account for the resource.
Confirm no access restrictions for your organization.
----
Delete your integration in Notion via theMy connected appssettings. You may also want to revoke the integration the corresponding platform:GitHub,Jira,Slack,Asana,Trello.
Try to unfurl again.
Finally, if all else fails, reach out to support! Unfortunately, we cannot help resolve errors related toAccess deniedorContent not found.Please provide the following information when reaching out to support:
Integration you’re trying to use
Error message and code
URL you’re trying to preview (if possible)
I’m receiving an “Access denied” or “Content not found” error in my link preview.
There are two possible reasons for this:
----
You may not have authenticated with the account that has access. You can connect multiple accounts either throughSettings & Members→My connected apps, or the error drop down.
Your organization may have limited access to content via 3rd party integrations or IP addresses. Please confirm with your workspace or organization administrator and ask to have Notion’s integration approved if this is the case. Here are instructions for specific integrations:GitHub,Jira,Slack,Asana,Trello.
What do connections have access to in my workspace?
SIEM integrations will be authorized to receive event logs on all workspace activity.
DLP integrations will be authorized:
to receive event logs on all workspace activity.
----
to view content, view comments, edit content, edit comments, and create comments inallpages.
to see basic information about all workspace members and guests, including their names, profile images, and email addresses.
I’m not seeing SIEM events even after connecting. What should I do?
Sometimes, the event may appear under a different label or in a different place than where you expect. We recommend triggering a new page event and querying in your SIEM querying language fortype: "page.created"oremail: "[your email address]"for all events triggered by you.
When a new Pantherinstance is created, it can take up to 10 minutes for it to be fully ready to receive events.
What happens to my SIEM events if my SIEM provider has an outage?
----
In the event of an outage, you should reach out to your SIEM provider for more information.
Why can’t I connect more than one instance of the same SIEM provider?
SIEM provider can only be connected to a single Notion workspace at this time.
Having trouble setting up your SIEM connections? Here are some common issues.
Incorrect webhook URL
Incorrect HMAC or HEC token
Do not have admin privileges in your SIEM provider
SIEM provider is an on-prem instance

Import from Asana
Importing from Asana allows you to move your organization’s teams, projects, and tasks in Asana into Notion. Any member on any plan can take advantage of the Asana importer.
Importing from Asana vs. syncing Asana with Notion
Importing your Asana data into Notion is best if you want to move from Asana and use Notion as the primary tool for your work. The data will be duplicated into Notion, but not synchronized with Asana.
Synced databasesallow you to connect Asana to Notion without importing any data. You might prefer to use synced databases if you use both Asana and Notion for your work. Synced databases only go one direction, meaning that changes will need to happen in Asana in order for updates to reflect in Notion.
----
To add a synced database from Asana, simply paste a project link right into a Notion page.Learn more about synced databases here →

Import projects from Asana for a connected work experience
Note:
You can only import one Asana workspace into Notion at a time.
Each Asana team will be imported into one Notion teamspace.
Multiple projects imported into one teamspace will go into the same Projects and Tasks databases. If you'd like to import into multiple databases, try importing in batches.
In the import process, there will be some default properties that you’ll be required to import into Notion from Asana.
To import from Asana into Notion:
----
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Import→Asana. Alternatively, use the/command/asanain a page and select the option underImport.
Sign into Asana and grant the requested permissions.

Select the Notion teamspace your projects should be imported into. Each Asana team will be imported into one Notion teamspace.
You can check the box next to your workspace name toExclude completed projectsorSelect all projects.
SelectNext.
----
By default, all Asana task properties will be imported into Notion, but you can customize this per teamspace. Choose toSelect all properties(the default setting) orCustomize properties. Note that there are default properties that must be imported.
Choose whether theStatusproperty in Notion should be mapped to yourSectionorCompletedproperty in Asana.
SelectImport.
Your selected Asana projects and properties will be imported along with the tasks associated with those selected projects. Asana projects and tasks will be imported into Projects and Tasks databases in Notion, respectively. The Notion Projects and Tasks databases are related to each other, in line with ourProjects & Tasks template.

By Project (table view): This view shows all tasks, grouped by project.
Board view: This view displays your tasks, grouped by status and sorted by descending priority. There are pre-set filters for assignee and due date.
All tasks (table view): This view shows you all of your imported tasks.
Mine (table view): This view is filtered to only show tasks that are assigned to you.
Calendar view: This view shows your tasks by date and displays assignee and status.
----
When your import completes, you will receive an import log in the private section of your sidebar. In this log you will find a summary of your import, including the Notion teamspace that your Asana projects and tasks were imported into.
How are the Task assignees imported if that assignee is not present in Notion?
If the Tasks assignees imported do not have a Notion, the user would be added as a placeholder to the workspace.
These placeholder accounts will attribute comments and mentions. If and when these users sign up, they will be mapped to the corresponding placeholder account, and comments and mentions will be attributed to the correct user.
How long does it take for the Asana Importer tool to import a large number of tasks?
----
Import times may range from a few minutes to several hours depending up on the size of the import. You will receive an email notification once the import is complete.
Is there a limit to the number of tasks that can be imported at once?
There are no hard limits on number of tasks that can be imported, but we recommend limiting imports to 20K tasks per teamspace.
How are subtasks imported?
They are imported as subtasks (along with dependencies) that are within the same  database.
Do updates I make in my Asana account automatically get updated in Notion?
No, the import is a one-time action.
----
We do not maintain a connection with your Asana account and any changes you make in your Asana account after the importwill notautomatically update in Notion.
Is there a way to preview the import before they are added? Can I undo an import?
There is no way to preview or undo, but during the process you will select which specific projects you wish to import.
In addition you can easily delete specific projects or tasks within Notion. You can even delete the entire database and start over.

Availability, blocking & time zones
On desktop and web, you can quickly indicate and share your availability directly from inside Notion Calendar to make it easier to schedule meetings with others.
To share your availability with someone:
SelectShare availabilityin your right context panel, or use the keyboard shortcutS.
Select open time slots in your calendar.
Set a name for the event you want to schedule during one of these time slots, as well as duration, the invitee’s time zone, and conferencing details.
SelectCreateon your availability. Calendar holds will be placed for your available dates and times so you can keep that time available for your invitees.
----
Notion Calendar won’t automatically detect changes to your calendar and update your availability, so make sure to keep your availability up to date as your schedule changes.
As you mark your availability and provide details for the meeting you’re trying to schedule, a message will automatically populate at the top of your right context panel. Select•••→Copy snippetto save this message to your clipboard. You can paste this and send it to your invitees in an email, text message, and more.
----
Turn onScheduling linkto generate a link that your invitees can go to to confirm when they’d like to meet with you. When turned on, this link will be included in your scheduling snippet. You can also select•••→Copy scheduling linkto quickly send it to someone. When your invitees visit your link, they’ll see your snippet along with your availability. They can choose a time slot that works for them. Then, your meeting with them will automatically appear on your calendar, and any unnecessary calendar holds will be released.
Note: At this time, it’s not possible to:
Indicate or take into account the availabilities of people other than yourself.
Change the content of your snippet.

Create multiple or repeat bookings using the same scheduling link.

Have a doctor’s appointment that you don’t want a teammate to schedule over? Notion Calendar’s blocking features make it easy to block events across your various calendars. For example, Notion Calendar can put a block on your work calendar for an event you have on your personal calendar, so people know you’re busy without being able to see your personal commitments. You can block single events or auto-block whole calendars.
On desktop or web:
Right-click an event and selectBlock on calendar.
----
Select the calendar you want to create a block in.
To create a block for a single event, selectThis event. Alternatively, you can selectAll events from {calendar name}to set up auto-blocking. For example, if you are creating a block on your work calendar for an event on your personal calendar, you can synchronize the two calendars so that all future events from your personal calendar will be blocked on your work calendar.
Choose toInclude detailsfrom the original calendar event in the block, or simplyShow as busy. This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto-block.
----
To see what details you’ve shared on a calendar block, right-click the original event and select Block on calendar. There will be a🔒next to the calendar where the block was set up — if the lock is open, that means the event’s details have been shared. If the lock is closed, that means the event’s details are hidden.
Alternatively, you can hide the original calendar from view by selecting the eye icon next to its name in the left sidebar. Then, you can find the block on your other calendar and see its details.
You can remove blocks the same way you created them. Right-click a blocked event and unselect the calendar where the block lives. You can unblock a single event, or turn off auto-blocking by unblocking all events.
----
You may want to undo auto-blocking for a calendar that you no longer have access to. We’re working to improve this experience, but in the meantime you can reach out toteam@makenotion.com.
In Notion Calendar, time zones are first-class citizens. You can add multiple time zones to your calendar, give them custom labels, and even temporarily travel to time zones.
Note: When you set up Notion Calendar for the first time, we get your primary time zone from Google Calendar. After that, any changes you make to your time zones in Notion Calendar won’t be reflected in Google Calendar, and vice versa.
Events on your calendar are displayed in your primary time zone. This time zone is displayed directly to the left of your calendar.
----
Use the keyboard shortcutcmd/ctrl+Kand enter “time zone” for quick access to time zone features.
Any new time zones you display on your calendar are secondary time zones. To add a time zone, select+next to your primary time zone. Select your desired time zone from the list that appears. This time zone will appear next to your other time zones.
If you’re on mobile, select the time zone on the very left of your calendar, then selectAdd time zone.
If you want to have more than four total time zones shown in your calendar,follow the instructions here →
Right-click a time zone, then:
SelectChangeto replace it with another time zone.
SelectRenameto give your time zone another name.
----
SelectMake time zone primary. This will bring this time zone closest to your calendar, and move any other time zones to the left.
SelectRemove time zone from list.
On desktop, you can rearrange your time zones by selecting and dragging them.The right-most time zone will become your primary time zone.
Use the keyboard shortcutZto travel to a new time zone. This time zone will temporarily become your primary time zone. You can permanently add this time zone to your calendar by right-clicking on it and selectingAdd as primary time zoneorAdd as secondary time zone.
To make changes to time zones on Notion Calendar for mobile, select a time zone, then selectMake time zone secondary,Make time zone primary,Add time zone, orRemove time zone.

Back up your data
Learn more about ourprivacy policyandsecurity practices.
Note:You must be a workspace admin to do this.
Your Notion data will always be backed up in the cloud, but you can also export it for safekeeping. You can export all your pages as HTML, Markdown, or CSV (for databases), along with any files you've uploaded, too.
If you're on a Business or Enterprise plan, you can also export your entire workspace to PDF, which can be helpful for legal and compliance backups.
----
Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace admins on the Enterprise plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.
A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace. The list items in the sitemap are locally linked to the exported pages in HTML and Markdown formats.
To export your workspace content:
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Settings.
Find and selectExport all workspace content.
----
You'll receive an email from Notion with a link to download your files. This link will expire after 7 days.
Note:
You can only export your entire workspace on desktop or web.
You can’t instantly recreate your workspace by reuploading your exported workspace content.
Note:By default, pages will remain in Trash for 30 days before they are automatically removed from Trash. Enterprise plan workspace owners may customize these settings.Learn more here →
To restore pages, go toTrash, find the page you're looking for, and click on the curved arrow icon next to it. Your page will return to where it was last in your workspace.

Billing, payments & refunds
Seeing something unexpected in your invoice? Be mindful of who you add to your workspace and what kind of role they have. Visitthis articleandour pricing pageto understand how we bill you depending on your plan and the users in your workspace.
Note:Only workspace owners can view and manage plans and billing.
Before we get into the details, here are the main points to understand about how you'll be billed for any Notion paid plan:
Every workspace is billed separately.You can create multiple workspaces per account (i.e. email address you signed up with), in which case you'd receive multiple bills.
This is why you might see multiple charges for Notion with only one account.
----
If you have multiple workspaces, you'll be billed based on how many members you have in each (on a Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan).
Even if the same people are in multiple workspaces, you'll be charged for them in each one. ⚠️
Your billing interval is also setper workspace. You could have one workspace billed annually and one billed monthly. Everyone who joins your workspace will add an additional charge based on the interval of that workspace.
You pay less if you pay yearly.
So, if two people join a workspace you're billed for monthly, you'll be charged for each of them.
----
We bill you upfront.You always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval. If you make changes in the middle of a billing interval, we'll prorate how much you're charged (or credited back), so that you only pay for what you actually used. These prorations will be applied at the start of the next billing interval.
Looking for information about pricing and billing for Notion AI?Read this article →
Note:If you want to downgrade your plan and purchase the Notion AI add-on at the same time:
You’ll be billed for Notion AI at a prorated cost for the remainder of your current billing period.
Your plan downgrade will go into effect after your current billing period ends.
To view the details of your plan and your billing information:
----
Go toSettings & membersat the top of your left-hand sidebar.
ClickBillingin the sidebar of the pop-up window.
At the top, you'll see which plan you're on (Free, Plus, or Enterprise), how much you're paying for it either yearly or monthly, and the date it will renew.
Note:You're charged per member, and also charged separately for each workspace on your plan. So if you have 2 workspaces with 10 people each, even if some belong to both workspaces, you'll still be charged for 20 members.
You can choose whether to pay for Notion on a monthly or yearly basis. This impacts both how much you pay and when you pay:
Yearly billing costs less.
Your plan renews automatically either once a month or once a year.
----
If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.
If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.
For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.
Go toSettings & membersat the top of your left-hand sidebar.
ClickBillingin the sidebar of the window that pops up.
ClickUpdatenext to your current billing interval and choose what you want.
When you change monthly to yearly, you'll establish a new billing cycle, with your plan automatically renewing on the calendar day you made this change the next year.
----
Whatever amount of time is left on your already paid monthly cycle will be subtracted from your annual payment. This can look like you are being double billed, but we promise you're not!
Note:Here's an example to show how changing your plan would impact your invoice!
Let's say you bought a Plus Plan on a monthly basis.
By April 15, you love Notion so much that you want to buy a yearly plan.
But you already paid for part of the month, so we prorate the price of your yearly plan.
Since half the month went by, we credit the unused time (the latter half of the month) from your yearly price.
----
When you change yearly to monthly, the new monthly billing cycle will take effect the day your annual cycle ends. Your plan will automatically renew each month on the same calendar day going forward.
On Notion for web, you can pay for your plan with a debit or credit card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. If you're in Europe, we also accept payment through SEPA direct debit (not credit transfer). You can also useStripe Linkto pay with a saved card or save your card for future use on any Stripe checkout. Notion usesStripeto process payments.
On an iOS device, you can pay with Apple Pay. Unfortunately, you can't make payments in the Android app at this time.
----
If you pay with debit or credit card, you're charged upfront for the month or year you're about to spend on Notion. If you pay with SEPA direct debit, you’ll receive a debit notification email. If you have been approved to pay via ACH or bank transfer, you'll receive an emailed invoice on the first day of your billing interval.
Note:All valid billing credits will expire six months from the date they are generated. Once credits have expired, they can’t be reinstated.
Go toSettings & membersin your left-hand sidebar.
ClickBillingin the sidebar of the window that pops up.
ClickUpdatenext to your payment method or billing email to change either.
ClickCredit or debit cardto enter a different debit or credit card.
----
Make your selection and hitUpdate. The change will be made immediately.
If you’re using SEPA for the first time to pay for your Notion plan, note that payment must fully process before you can make any changes to your plan, add or remove AI, or update your payment method. We also won’t be able to assist with refunds while your payment is processing.
You can, however, add or remove members from your workspace during this time. These changes will be reflected in your next invoice.
----
Our refund policy is simple. If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Notion subscription online or in-app, please contact us inside the app or emailteam@makenotion.com. We'll be happy to refund you the full amount if you downgrade your subscription within 72 hours of signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of signing up for annual billing.
If you were invoiced for members accidentally added to your workspace, we're happy to provide a refund of the prorated charges if you reach out within 72 hours of the invoice date. Please make sure the additional members have been removed from your workspace before writing in.

I just upgraded to a paid plan, but one of my workspaces still says it's on a free plan.
Plans only apply to a single workspace and don't cover your whole account. We recommend using the fewest workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.More on that here.
How can I avoid needing multiple workspaces?
----
We've seen people create multiple workspace instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, their executive team, etc. so they can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. You don't need to do this. Instead:
DisableWorkspace Access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.
On every page,grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.
----
So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn onFull Accessfor only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!
How can I update my invoices to include my billing address and/or VAT number?
We can update this info for you! Just message us in the app by clicking ? at the bottom right on the desktop app (or in your sidebar on mobile). Or email us atteam@makenotion.com.

Plans, members, billing intervals. The amount you pay for Notion is a combination of these variables. We're here to help you understand exactly what you're paying for and how to track this in your invoices 🧾

Sometimes, it makes sense to put pieces of information next to each other. In these situations, you can format your text into columns (or create side-by-side sections with headings) using drag and drop:
Click and drag the text you want to put in another column. (The⋮⋮symbol in the left margin is your handle for drag and drop.)
Follow the blue guides that appear.
Drop it where you want it. You just created a new column!
You can create as many columns as you want across the width of a page.
Note:Columns are available on tablet but not mobile. On your phone, you'll see the content in any right-hand column simply placed under the content in the left column.
----
To remove columns, simply do the reverse of the action you took to create them.
Click the⋮⋮icon and hold to drag the content in your right-hand column back under or above the content in the left-hand column. When you see the blue guide span the width of the page, drop it and the columns should disappear.
Sometimes, it's possible to have an empty column. In this case, click the⋮⋮icon and selectDelete. This also removes the column format.
Tip:You can resize columns by hovering over the edges they share with other content and dragging the gray vertical guides that appear left or right.
Need to structure content in a visual matrix? Use a simple table!
----
Click the+in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line, and select theTableoption.
Or, type/followed bytableand thenenter.
To add or remove columns, hover over the right side of the table. Click and drag the+button.
To add or remove rows, hover over the bottom of the table. Click and drag the+button.
You can also drag the+button at the bottom right to add/remove rowsandcolumns at the same time!
Use theOptionsmenu to toggle on row and column headers for additional visual distinction in the form of a colored header background.
Click the←→option to snap your table to page or column width!
----
While a simple table lets you quickly visualize information, you can convert it to a database any time you need database functionality such as filters, sorts, or specific property value types.Learn more about databases here →
Click the•••menu hovering at the top of the simple table. ClickTurn into database.
Tip:Not sure whether a simple table or a database is a better fit for your content?Check out this helpful guide comparing the two, with best practices on how to use each →
Using different sizes of headings throughout your writing gives your information more structure, context, and a sense of priority. Notion makes three sizes of headings available.
----
Click the+in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line, and select the size heading you want. See the menu in the image below.
Type/followed byh1,h2, orh3and thenenter.
Use Markdown and type#for H1,##for H2, or###for H3, then pressspace.
Type whatever you want. Then, presscmd/ctrl+/and choose a heading size to convert the text!
If you're working on a long document with lots of headings, you may want to add a table of contents to help your readers and collaborators easily skim the page’s content and easily jump to any section.
----
In a table of contents, you’ll see a list of all the headings used in your page. H2s and H3s will be indented to reflect your page’s structure. Click on any of the headings in your table of contents to go to that heading in the page.
A table of contents can appear in a page in two ways:
At the top of your page, as a block.
At the right side of your page as you scroll through it, as a page-level setting.
There are a few ways to add a table of contents block in Notion:
Hover over a new block on your page and select+. In the menu that appears, find and selectTable of contents.
Enter/in a page and start typingtable of contents. SelectTable of contentsin the menu that appears.
----
Note:Your table of contents block is a single unit that must be moved, deleted, duplicated, and styled as a unit. To edit the text it contains, edit the actual headings on your page.
You’ll see a table of contents in the right side of your Notion page by default if your page has two or more headings. This table of contents will follow you as you scroll through the page so you can access it at any time. Hover over the table of contents to expand it and see all of the headings in your page.
If you don’t want to see a page-level table of contents:
In the page you want to remove the table of contents from, select•••.
Toggle offTable of contents.
----
Breaking up content on a page can help you separate distinct sections and ideas. Dividers are a good way to distinguish these sections and add some stylistic flair to your page.
Click the+in the left margin that appears when you hover over a new line and select theDividerblock from the menu.
Type/followed bydivand thenenter.
Type---(three hyphens in a row) and a divider will automatically pop up.
You can drag and drop these dividers just like any other block on your page.
Why can't I see columns on my phone or tablet?
Unfortunately, our mobile apps don't support multiple columns yet, but it's definitely on our to-do list!
Will my table of contents show titles of in-line tables on my page?
----
No. Even if you give your table a name in your document, this won't be reflected in the table of contents. You can, however, add a heading above the database that will appear.
If I turn individual headings a color, will that show in my table of contents?
Your table of contents will always be all one color 🖌You can change this color, and it will will apply to the whole thing. To do this:
Click the⋮⋮icon that appears when you hover over your table of contents. Or select it and hitcmd/ctrl+/. Or right click.
ChooseColorfrom the menu that pops up and select which color or highlight you want.
Can I edit the text inside my table of contents?
Not directly! In order to change the text it displays, edit the individual heading blocks in your page.

There are a few ways to leave a top-level comment on a database page:
Open the page and add a top-level page comment there.
If the page already has comments, you’ll see💬associated with it in your database. Select💬to read the existing comments, then add your own. You’ll also be able to do the same from theSuggested for youandTrendingwidgets inHome.

When you want to get other people in your workspace to look at something, you can mention them anywhere inside a page, database, comment, or discussion.
Type@followed by the person or group's name. A pop up menu will search for them in real-time. Pressenterto choose the one you want.
----
Tip:You can hover over an @-mentioned group to get a preview of its members. The preview is limited to 10 members, so if you'd like a complete list:
FindSettings & membersand thenMembersin the sidebar.
SelectGroupsat the top and you'll find a list of groups.
Click the dropdown of any group to see a complete list of members.
To mention someone in a database, either @-mention them in the body of a page inside the database, or add them to aPersonproperty field. They'll receive the same type of notification. This is handy for assigning people things in a tasks database.
----
To reference and add an inline link to another page inside a Notion page, type@followed by the page's title. You'll see a menu pop up that'll search for that page in real-time. Find the right one and pressenter. Now you and others can jump to the linked page directly.
If you change the title of a page, the @-mention links that go to it will also reflect that change automatically.
Tip: Whenever you @-mention a page, a backlink is created automatically!Learn more about backlinks →
When you type@followed by a date (or the wordstoday, tomorrow,oryesterday), you'll add an inline timestamp to your page. For example, typing@1/12automatically adds a timestamp that looks like: January 12, 2021.
----
Note:The wordstoday, tomorrow,andyesterdayturn into their corresponding numbered dates as time passes.
When someone mentions you in a workspace, you'll see a red badge appear next toInboxin your sidebar with the number of notifications waiting for you.
OpenInboxto see all the times you've been mentioned organized chronologically.
You may also see mobile or desktop push notification depending on the apps you have installed and open.
Click on any of these mention updates to jump directly to the line, comment, discussion or database you've been mentioned in on the page.
Note:If you @-mention someone on a page that they don't have access to (like one of your private pages), they will not be notified.
----
If you were mentioned in a comment, you can reply directly from yourInboxby clickingReply.
You can also resolve or re-open comments in this window. When you resolve a comment, it will disappear from the page it was made on. If you re-open a comment, it will reappear.
When you add a reminder, Notion will send you a notification to draw your attention back to a particular task, event, or page at the time you specify. This is helpful for setting due dates and making sure you never forget a thing.
Inline on a page, type@remindfollowed by a time, date, or both, i.e.@remind tomorrow,@remind 7pm, or@remind Wednesday at 1pm. This will create a blue tag.
----
Clicking this tag opens up a calendar window where you can edit the date and time, change your timezone, and set exactly how you want to be reminded (i.e. 30 minutes beforehand).
Inline reminders turn red when they change to @Today or are past due.
In a database, add aDateproperty. When you click on that property (like on a cell in that column of a table), a calendar window opens where you can select when and how you want to be reminded. You can add a specific time of day as well.
When you set a reminder, you'll be notified at the chosen time in a few ways:
You'll see a red badge pop up next toInboxat the top of your left sidebar.
If you have the desktop Notion app, you'll receive a push notification immediately.
----
If you have the mobile Notion app, you'll receive a push notification within 5 minutes.
If Notion isn't open at the time of your reminder, you'll get a mobile push notification (if you have the app) and an email.
Someone @-mentioned me in a page, but I didn't receive an email notification.
If you have Notion open on a mobile device or computer, you won't receive push or email notifications for reminders, you'll only get a red badge notification inAll Updates.
If Notion is not open on your mobile device or computer at the time of the notification, then you'll receive an email instead of a notification inAll Updates.
What's the difference between @-mentioning a page, and adding a Link to page block?
----
Link to pageworks kind of like creating a sub-page. When you reference a Notion page this way, it will show up in your sidebar as a subpage of the page where it was linked.
@-mentioning a page creates something more like a hyperlink. Pages you @-mention won’t show up as subpages of the pages they’ve been mentioned in.
How can I trigger a reminder for someone else on my team?
The best way to do this is to use an @-mention and @-remind on the same line. For example:
"@Camille Ricketts@remind next Thursday 4pmto finish proofreading."
Does Notion have recurring reminders? Like "remind me every Monday to water the plants"?
Not at the moment, but recurring tasks and recurring reminders are on the roadmap!

Connect a custom domain with Notion Sites
Note:The following is only available on paid plans.
Workspace owners on paid plans can connect their existing custom domains with Notion Sites by purchasing the custom domain add-on.Notion doesn’t sell custom domains or replace your current domain provider— the add-on allows you to use Notion Sites with a custom domain you already own.
Once a workspace owner on a paid plan connects a custom domain with Sites, they'll be charged an additional $10 per month.Note that with annual billing, you’ll unlock a discounted rate for the custom domain add-onof an additional $8 per month.
----
For each custom domain you want to use with Notion Sites, you’ll have to purchase a separate custom domain add-on. You can do this for up to 25 custom domains.
Billing for the custom domain add-on must match your billing for Notion — if you pay for Notion annually, you’ll also be billed annually for the custom domain. If you pay for Notion monthly, you’ll also be billed monthly for the custom domain.
If you add a custom domain to your existing paid plan, you’ll pay a prorated amount for the remaining time left on your current billing cycle. On your next billing date, the custom domain add-on charge will be added to your regular billing cadence.
To connect a custom domain with Notion Sites:
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Sites.
----
Next toDomains, selectNew domain.
SelectCustom domain→Continue.You’ll be prompted to set up a payment method for this add-on if you don’t already have one on file.
Enter your custom domain →Continue.
There are a few important rules to follow when adding your domain to ensure a smooth setup:
You must already have purchased your domain from a DNS provider.
When entering your domain,you must include a subdomain. This is typicallywww, but any other subdomain works too (ex.:careers.my-domain.comorportfolio.my-domain.com).
If you want your root domain to point to your Notion Site, we recommend setting up your subdomain towwwand setting up a redirect with your DNS provider. Here are some instructions from common providers for how to set this up:
----

https://www.godaddy.com/help/forward-my-godaddy-domain-12123
https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/214767107-Forwarding-a-Squarespace-domain
You’ll be prompted to go to your DNS provider and add a CNAME record for the domain you want to connect. Set the CNAME target toexternal.notion.site.

https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002101888-Adding-custom-DNS-records-to-your-Squarespace-managed-domain
Next, add a TXT record for the domain. You can copy the record name and value for easy use.
SelectVerify.
Once you add a custom domain, you’ll see it and its status in your list of domains.
When you use a custom domain with Notion Sites, you’ll also have the option to remove any Notion branding for that custom domain. Learn more about customizing your Sites inthis article →
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Sites.
----
Next to your desired domain, select•••.
From here, selectDeleteto remove your domain. If any Notion Sites have been published to the domain you’re trying to delete, you’ll be asked to unpublish those Sites before proceeding.
Note:When you delete a custom domain, you'll still be able to use it with Notion Sites until the end of your current billing cycle. After that time, you will no longer be charged for that custom domain.
In the setup below, the name of the TXT record is set tonotesbut should instead be_notion-dcv.notes. The value of the record is set to_notion-dcv.notesbut should instead be the unique TXT record code provided in Notion when you’re setting up the custom domain.
----
In the setup below, the CNAME host is set toexternal.notion.sitebut should instead be set to your desired subdomain, likecareers.my-domain.com. The CNAME value is correctly set toexternal.notion.site.
Below are instructions for setting up your CNAME and TXT records with some of the most common DNS providers.
Note:
The screenshots used below are just examples. Make sure you use your specific values as you follow the steps!
For more help setting up, please reach out to your DNS provider.
Find your domain and selectManage DNS.
Add the CNAME and TXT DNS record. In this example, because we’re setting up the subdomainwww.my-domain.com, the CNAME will be set towww. Make sure to adjust accordingly depending on your chosen subdomain.
----

SelectSave.
Add the TXT record.
SelectSave.
If you would like to set up your top-level domain (in this case,my-domain.co.uk) to redirect to the domain you have set up with Notion (www.my-domain.co.uk), open theForwardingtab. Then, selectSet upand enter your domain.
Note:Your DNS records might display a period at the end of your subdomain. While in general this shouldn’t impact your setup, you can try removing this if you’re having issues connecting your custom domain with Notion Sites.

Create a database
Add a new page and underGet started withand selectTable.
The first column is where you enter the name of your database pages. Each column in a Notion table corresponds to a property that gives your item context.
Click a property heading, thenEdit propertyandTypeto see all of your property choices.
For this example, we'll create a task database.
Add some tasks you're working on in theNamecolumn.
Now add some values to theTagscolumn using the multi-select property. The options could be something likeP1,P2, andP3to indicate the priority of a task.
Add a new property using the+button to the right of theTagsheading.
----
Change its name toDue Date. Click the property heading, thenEdit propertyandTypeand selectDate. Now when you click on a cell underDue Date, you'll see the date picker.
Every item in a Notion database is also a whole page of its own! You can add any content you want inside, including other databases.
In our task database example, this would let you keep all notes and content related to a task neatly bundled inside that task.
To open a row as a page, hover over a cell in theNamecolumn and clickOPEN.
You can add or edit any properties. You can also add additional content into the body of the page.
----
You can create different views of the same data. Put it into a board, a calendar, a list, a gallery, or a timeline — depending on your needs. Let's try one.
Click+at the top of your table. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and selectAdd view.
Give your new view a name and chooseBoardfrom the right-side menu.
This displays rows from your table into cards on a board, grouped by tag. Clicking on a card still opens it as a page. It's all the same content, just visualized in a different way!
Learn more about views here →
Tip:Different views are good for different things, and you can have as many as you need!
Gallery view is great if you're storing images in your database.
----
Lists are helpful for minimalist storage of documentation.
Calendar view displays your pages by an assigned date property.
Timelines are useful for visualizing project dates and length.
Filter by property to focus on specific parts of your database.
Click the filter icon at the top of your table, then select one of the default options or+ Add advanced filter.
Then select the criteria that needs to be met. The middle dropdown will give you different options depending on the property.
In this case, let's chooseTagsas the property, and say it must containP1.
Add sorts to reorder your database depending on property values. Sorts are helpful for quickly ordering your data by priority, date, tags, etc.
----
Click⇅at the top of your table, then select the property you'd like to sort by.
For example, chooseDue Dateand thenAscending. This reorders tasks from closest to furthest due date.
You'll see your database change in real time based on your filter and sort criteria. You can add as many filters and sorts as you want, and each view has its own filter and sorts.

Create a subpage
A subpage is a page inside a page. You can create any number of subpages for a page.
There are multiple ways to create a subpage:
Open a page (this will be the subpage’s parent page) and use the slash command/page.
Find your desired parent page in your sidebar and select+next to it. This will create a subpage in that page. When you return to the parent page, you’ll see the subpage there.
Once your new page opens, you can give your page a title and start jotting down your thoughts.

Create & manage workspaces
By default, your workspace switcher will display all the workspaces associated with your email address. To create another workspace:
Open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window.
Choose which email account you'd like the new workspace to be associated with, and click the•••to the right of that email address.
ClickJoin or create workspace.
If you're using your work email, you may see a list of workspaces that you can auto-join. We'll cover that just below!
If you want to create a brand new workspace, scroll past the list of existing workspaces and clickCreate workspace.
Follow the steps to set up your new workspace and you're on your way!
----
Tip: Multiple workspaces come in handy to separate different kinds of work. For example, you could have one workspace for personal stuff, one for school notes, and one for keeping track of freelance projects.
There are a couple ways to join a workspace someone else has made:
An admin from that workspace adds you as a member, and you receive an email with a link to join. You'll be prompted to sign in with your email, and you'll be placed into the workspace as a paid member.
If your email domain (e.g. name@domain.com) has auto-join enabled, you can use theJoin or create workspacebutton in the workspace switcher, and you'll see a list of workspaces you can join.
----
Note:If you're using Notion with a personal email address such as gmail.com or outlook.com, or a school email address such as nyu.edu, you won't be able to auto-join other workspaces.
To join a workspace from another email account, use theAdd another accountbutton in the workspace switcher.
Throughout the day, you might need to hop between different workspaces to get things done. Just click on the name of your current workspace and select the one you want to jump to from the dropdown menu. That's it!
Tip:On desktop, you can use the shortcutctrl+shift+#to switch workspaces, in which#corresponds to the placement of each workspace in the dropdown workspace switcher menu.
You'll see the shortcuts in the menu, next to each workspace name!
----
Click onSettings & membersin your left sidebar. Then click on theSettingstab.
Scroll down to the headingDanger zone. ClickLeave workspace.
It'll be removed from your workspace switcher and you'll lose access to all that content.
You can always ask an admin in a workspace you've left to re-add you.
Click onSettings & membersin your left sidebar. Then click on theSettingstab.
Scroll down toDanger zone. ClickDelete entire workspace. You'll be asked to type the name of your workspace just to double check that this is what you want to do.
All of that content will be deleted and you'll be returned to another workspace you belong to, or the sign up page for Notion if you don't belong to any others.
----
By default, your workspace switcher will display all the workspaces associated with your email address. But you may prefer to use your personal email with your personal workspaces, and your work email with your team workspaces.
To enable you to view all of your workspaces at once, we support logging in with multiple accounts at the same time!
To add workspaces from another Notion account, open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and clickAdd another account.
Follow the steps to login to your other account, and you'll be taken straight to that workspace. You can also create a new account at this step.
----
The next time you open the workspace switcher, you'll see the new account and all of its workspaces added to the dropdown.
Tip: By adding more accounts to your workspace switcher, there's no need to log out of one account in order to log into another! This lets you keep work and life separate, while making sure that you can access any of your content across any account, on any device, completely seamlessly.
You can log out of individual accounts, or log out of all your accounts at once.
Open the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window.
To log out of one account but stay logged into others, use the•••button to the right of the account you want to log out of. Then, clickLog out.
----
To log out of all your accounts at once, use theLog out allbutton at the bottom of the workspace switcher.
Note: Login tokens expire after 90 days. When you're logged out of your accounts due to token expiration, you will need to re-add any additional accounts by using theAdd another accountbutton in the workspace switcher.
How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?
Note:Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information,click here.
----
To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click•••next to each of the top-level pages in your sidebar (or right click) and selectMove to.At the bottom of the move menu, you’ll see a drop down to select a different workspace.
When you move top-level pages, all their sub-pages go with them. They'll appear in thePrivatesection but can be moved wherever you want to put them.
I clicked the Join or create workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?
You can only join a workspace via theJoin or create workspacebutton if that workspace has theAllowed Email Domainssetting enabled to allow users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.
----
Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.
When I subscribe to a paid plan, does it cover all of my workspaces?
Paid plans only apply to one workspace and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate silos, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.
How can I switch between workspaces that are under different email addresses?
To add your workspaces from another email account, use theAdd another accountbutton in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account.
----
Is there a limit to the number of accounts I can be signed into?
There is currently no limit, although you may experience slower performance if you're logged into 10+ accounts at once.
I forgot to log out of my account on a public computer, or my device was stolen.
So sorry for the trouble 😓 If you're still logged in on a device you have access to,  navigate toSettings & Membersand thenMy account. Scroll down to the "Log out of all devices" section and click the arrow.
If you no longer have access to your account, please send us a quick message to team@makenotion.com, or use the ? button at the bottom right of the app. We can log you out remotely!

Paste the URL.
In the menu that appears, selectPaste as mention.
The web page will be displayed with an icon, the source, and the title of the page.
Note:
Link mentions work best with public web pages. Any links that require certain permissions or authentication to view won’t be pasted into Notion with any rich information.
If your browser has cookies blocked, link mentions may not render properly.

What's the difference between @-mentioning a page, and adding a Link to page block?
Link to pageworks kind of like creating a sub-page. When you reference a Notion page this way, it will show up in your sidebar as a subpage of the page where it was linked.
@-mentioning a page creates something more like a hyperlink. Pages you @-mention won’t show up as subpages of the pages they’ve been mentioned in.

Every page, whether it's a database or not, can have its own icon — either an emoji or an image you upload yourself (like your logo). It'll appear at the top left of your page and in the sidebar next to it. This helps make pages memorable and easy to find.
There are a few ways to add page icons:
Hover over the top of any page and clickAdd icon.

Can I make Full width my default? Is there a way to set a default style for all pages?
Not yet, but a lot of users have asked for this! We're continuing to keep this in mind for future projects.
Can I justify text to be center aligned or right aligned?
Notion doesn't have any traditional alignment options at the moment, unfortunately 😕But you can still make this happen. Drag and drop an empty line into the column next to your text to align it to the right or left.
Why can't I change text size on mobile?
This styling option, along with page width, only exists on desktop and web.
What's the ideal size and aspect ratio for cover images?
----
The cover images are dynamic depending on the width of your window, so there's no specific size that works best. That said, we recommend using images at least 1,500 pixels wide.
How can I insert an emoji in-line with my text 🤔?
Anywhere in your text, type:followed by the name of the emoji you want to use, like:firefor 🔥 or:clappingfor 👏
You can also use your system emoji picker to include emojis in-line on a Notion page, or anywhere else on your computer!

Data accessible by your workspace owner
If you are accessing any Notion workspace using an email address or account assigned to you by your employer or other organization (for example, you use your work email to access a workspace administered by your employer), it is important to note that the workspace owner could have access to the data you store in that Notion workspace, including any private pages in that workspace. Additionally, the workspace owner can turn off Notion services or restrict your ability to move data to or from the organizational workspace. Please read ourTerms of Servicefor more information.
----
If you access Notion with an email address or account assigned to you by your employer or other organization, your agreement or legal relationship with that workspace owner might affect:
Who owns the data or content that you submit or upload through your account
The conditions under which you may access your account or when your account may be disable.
Who may access or delete the data in your account.
Please note, whenever you access anEnterprisePlan workspace (as a member or a guest), the workspace owners will have access to the data you store in that Notion workspace.
VisitSettings & membersin your workspace to view the workspace owners of your account.

Data sources & linked databases
When you make a database, you’ll be given the option to select an existing data source from the workspace or to a create a brand new one.
We suggest selecting an existing data source if you want to use the same properties from another database, or an existing view living elsewhere in your workspace. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.
We suggest creating a new data source if the information you're adding to the database is completely new and doesn’t exist anywhere else in your workspace, or if you want to keep it separate from other data. To create a new database, clickNew table,New list, etc. (depending on the type of view you are creating) in the menu that appears.
----
Think of each linked database as a two-way excerpt of the source database. It references the same source data, but has its own views, filters, and sorts.
In a page, type/linkedand press enter.
A menu will pop up that allows you to type to search for specific databases in your workspace. You can also scroll to browse.
The database you select will show up as a copy of the original, which you can filter, sort, and view differently without changing the original.
When interacting with a linked database, the views, filters, or sorts you create and delete will not affect the views on the original database.
However, edits you make to theactual contentorpropertiesof a linked databasewillbe reflected in the original.
----
You can add as many linked databases as you would like in-line on a single page. Filter them for different purposes to create your own dashboard.
I tried sharing a page with a linked database, but the recipient wasn't able to see it.
Whoever you share this type of page with needs to have access to the original database to be able to see any linked excerpts of that database.
Can I name my linked database something different from the original database?
Not at the moment. We've had a few users ask about this though, so it's on our to-do list!
Here’s how to make sure your databases are always feeling quick and snappy 🏃🏼

Database automations
What’s new with database automations
Newandcondition: You can now specify more than one condition in your automation trigger.
Advanced triggers: Automations can be triggered by specific values for properties like person, number, text, select, and relation.
Add or remove: You can now add, remove, or toggle selections for multi-select, person, and relation properties, instead of overriding the entire selection.
----
Database automations are sequences of actions that happen any time a specific change to a database occurs. Automations consist of both triggers (the events that initiate the automation) and actions (the effect of the automation). Database automations are meant to help save you time and simplify your work, and can be very basic or more complex depending on your needs.
Database automations can be used for many things, including:
Assigning a task to a specific person when its status changes.
Sending a Slack notification to a channel when a page is added to a database.
Note:
----
Database automations are available on paid plans on all platforms.Free plan users can create Slack notification automations and use, but not edit, existing automations in templates.
Database automations can be created, edited, or deleted by anyone with full access to the database.Slack automationsare the only exception. These can only be edited by the automation creator.
Automations won’t take action on any pages whose access is restricted.You can check and change page access in theshare menu.
Actions triggered by automations can’t trigger other automations.
To create a database automation:
Click⚡at the top of a database → New automation.
Give your database automation a name if you’d like.
----
Add triggers. Learn more about the types of triggersbelow →
Add actions. Learn more about the types of actionsbelow →
SelectSave.
Did you know you can also add a button property to your database? With the click of a button, actions can be taken on your database on your behalf.Learn more here →
Automations can have one trigger or multiple triggers. When you set up an automation, you can decide whether the automation will take placeWhen any of these occurorWhen all of these occur.
Note:If you have multipleis editedtriggers that mustalloccur for your automation to take place, those triggers need to happen within a small window of about three seconds. If they don’t, your automation may not be triggered properly. To avoid this, you can:
----
Create separate automations for each trigger.
Use a more specific trigger thanis edited, likeis set toorcontains.
You can choose from two types of triggers:Page addedorProperty edited.
If you choose aProperty editedtrigger, you can indicate which properties from your database will trigger the automation.
For name, person, number, text, select, and relation properties, you can choose what kinds of edits made to that property will trigger an automation. For example, you might have a list of contacts in a Notion database and set up an automation where the trigger is a phone number starting with the numbers 732, and the action is that person’s state being set to New Jersey.
----
You can also have more than one condition for your trigger so that two or more things must be true for the automation to occur.
Automations can take one action or multiple actions. You can choose from a variety of actions:
Edit propertywill edit the properties of pages in the database you are currently in.
Add page towill add a page to a database of your choosing, and edit the properties of that page.
Edit pages inwill edit pages and properties in a database of your choosing.
----
Send notification towill send a notification to specific people in your Notion workspace. Your recipient can be up to 20 people in your workspace, or people who are associated with a certain People property in your database. Add a message that you want to go along with the notification.
Send Slack notification to…will send a notification to the Slack channel you want.
If you choose anEdit propertytrigger, you can indicate how you want those properties to be updated.
----
For multi-select, people, and relation properties, you can add or remove individual values instead of adding or removing all values at once. For example, you might have a task database where if the task name contains the word “blog”, your name is added to the people property, even if there are other people already assigned to that task.
Get more inspiration for using database workflows inthis guide →
To see and manage all of the automations for a database:
Click⚡at the top of a database.
This⚡will only appear if you have active automations.
Hover over the automation and click•••.
SelectEdit,Pause, orDelete.
How frequently is the database scanned for “changes” in properties?
----
Database automations work over a three second window. For example, within this three second window, a user can remove a trigger and delete any changes, resulting in no property change to the automation.
Do automations work on pages in the entire database, or pages in a single database view?
Either one. During the creation process, you can specify if the automation should run on pages in the entire database, or in a specific view. If any filters in that view change, the automation will then apply to the adjusted list of pages.
Can guests with full access to a database create automations?
Unfortunately, guests can't create database automations.
----
In a Notion database, you can add a formula property that lets you run all kinds of calculations and functions based on other properties. You can use formulas to manipulate existing data and arrive at many other helpful values 🔮

Database buttons automate your workflows so you don’t have to spend as much time manually updating your database. For example, you could use a button to approve a document or mark a daily habit as complete. Buttons can be added to your database as a property, and when a button is clicked, it’ll take actions on database pages so you don’t have to.
To add a database button property:
Select•••at the top right of your database →Properties→New property→Button.
Add a label for your button, likeApproveorComplete.
----
Add an action for your button. This is the action you want to have taken when the button is selected. Multiple actions can be taken using one button. You can select from:
Add page to...: This will add a page to a database of your choice.
Edit pages in...: This will edit properties for pages in a database of your choice.
Show confirmation: This will show a message to the person who has selected the button before any further action is taken. You could pair this with another action so that you can be more careful with edits made to your database.
Open page: This will open a page from a database of your choice. You can also decide how the page will open on the screen.

Database templates
To create a template inside a database, click the dropdown arrow next toNewat the top right of your database. Then, select+ New template.
When editing a new or existing template, you'll see a bar across the top indicating which database it's located in.
Whatever you title this page will be the name of the template you use going forward. For instance, you might title this oneBug.
On this page, you can define properties for your template. For example, you can create a template for bug reports that automatically putsP1in the Priority property and assigns the userFigto the Product Manager property. You can also add content in the page itself.
----
Templates can contain any type of content, including images, embeds, and sub-pages. Whatever you choose will show up identically on each page created with the template.
Note:If you add a relation property to a template, do not fill it in unless you want every page you create with that template to relate to the same existing page(s).
Create a new page in your database and choose any of the templates from the gray menu it contains.
You can also click the dropdown menu on the right of the blueNewbutton at the top right of your database. Choose any template you've created to generate that type of page.
Give the page a unique title.
Once you've created a new page with a template, you can make any changes you want to the content that appeared.
----
Repeating database templates automatically create a copy of a template in your database however often you would like.
To create a repeating database template:
Open the dropdown next toNewor+(depending on your screen size) at the top of your database.
Next to the database template you want to repeat, select•••.
Open the dropdown next toRepeat.
You can make your template repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. Indicate how many weeks, months, or years you want in between repeats, as well as your start date and the time you want your database template to be repeated.
You may want to create a database inside of a recurring database template, with that database having templates of its own. While this is possible, be mindful of the limitations:
----
You can’t nest a template within a template that recurs daily. You can only nest a template within a template that recurs weekly, monthly, or yearly.
You can only have three levels of nesting per database template.
Open the dropdown next to+orNewat the top of your database.
Click•••next to the template you want to edit and clickEdit. Make your changes in the editing view that pops up.
The same•••menu also lets you duplicate or delete a template.
Are the templates I create in one database available in all other databases in my workspace?
No, they're only available in the specific database where you created them. For every new database you create, you can define new templates.
How do relation properties work with templates?
----
While you can create relation properties in database templates, we don't recommend that you define them unless you want every page of a certain type to be related to the same page(s).
Is there a limit to the number of database templates I can make?
Nope! You can make as many as you want.

Deploy Notion for macOS
Notion's desktop app provides IT administrators with enhanced control over installations and updates. You have the flexibility to select the installation path for Notion and manage update settings. By default, the Notion app is set up in the /Applications folder on your employees’ machines and is configured to update automatically with each new release.
Note:Regular updates are crucial for access to the latest features and ensuring the highest level of security, especially if automatic updates are turned off.
----
Notion allows for use on shared machines by multiple users. It can be installed in either the /Applications or ~/Applications folder of a user's machine. The best installation method depends on your organization's specific needs.
/Applications
All users on the machine use the same installation of Notion.
Updates made to Notion apply to all users on the machine.
Users must be administrators to update Notion.
~/Applications
Each user on a shared machine has their own installation of Notion.
Updates made to one instance of Notion do not affect other instances of Notion for other users on the same machine.
Users do not need to be administrators to update Notion.
----
After deciding on the installation method, download the appropriate Notion desktop app build. There are three builds available:Intel (x64),Apple Silicon (arm64), andUniversal (x64 or arm64). Ensure you distribute the correct build to match your employees' machine types.
Note:The Universal build works on Intel and Apple Silicon machines. Keep in mind the installation file is much larger than the other builds.
Notion allows you to disable automatic updates for individual users. This feature is useful for when you want to test new Notion app versions before a widespread rollout, or if you prefer to stagger the update process. To keep the app working smoothly and securely, we advise updating Notion with each new version release.
----
To prevent Notion from automatically checking for updates, run the following terminal command as each user who will be running Notion:
defaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool YES
Use the following command to re-enable automatic updates:
defaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool NO
If Notion is installed in the ~/Applications folder, users can update the app independently without needing special permissions. However, if the app is installed in the /Applications folder, update permissions are required.Users must be machine administrators and have write access to /Applications, notion.app, and all its subfiles.
----
For shared machines, we recommend setting up a permissions group for all Notion users and installing Notion in a subfolder of /Applications. You can grant this group ownership and write access to the subfolder using the terminal command below. Make sure you replacegroupwith your permissions group name andsubfolderwith your subfolder name:
chown -R :group /Applications/subfolder && chmod -R 775 /Applications/subfolder

Domain management
Domain verification allowsBusiness and Enterprise workspace ownersto claim ownership over an email address domain associated with their workspace. This unlocks domain management settings likeconfiguring SAML SSOfor your workspace, building Notion integrations usinglink previews, andcontrolling who can create workspaces(for Enterprise plans only).
Domain verification does not impact your billing.
Note: To do this, you must be a workspace owner on a Business or Enterprise plan.
InSettings & members, navigate to theIdentity & provisioningtab and complete the following steps to verify your domain.
Within theDomain managementsection, click theAdd domainbutton.
----
Type in the domain that you wish to verify and click theNextbutton.
The domain will be added to the list of your verified domains in aPendingverification (designated with the color yellow).
Update the DNS record.
After updating the DNS record,  ClickVerifyto notify Notion to check your DNS record.
Once verification is complete, you’ll receive a confirmation email and the domain will be displayed in green.
Note:
Typically, a change in the DNS record takes only minutes to propagate; however, there are cases where it may take up to 72 hours.
You must verify a domain within one week of adding the domain. After a week, the verification code will expire and you’ll have to repeat the steps above.
----
If you’re building an integration with Notion, like Link Previews, you’ll need to verify your domain in the integration management page (this action will not take place in Notion).
You can find the full instructions in ourDeveloper Guides →
Prerequisites for customizing workspace creation permissions
Workspace must be on the Enterprise Plan.
You must be a workspace owner.
You have verified at least one domain.Instructions for domain verification can be found above →
You can customize permissions for who can create new workspaces using your verified domain(s).
InSettings & members, go toIdentity & provisioningand thenWorkspace creation.
SelectAnyoneto allow any user with your verified domain to create a new workspace.
----
SelectWorkspace ownersto prevent users with your verified domain from creating new workspaces.
Note:The default setting for workspace creation permissions once a domain is verified is workspace owners only.
Once a domain is verified, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can transfer, delete, or claim ownership over non-Enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain.
Prerequisites for viewing claimable workspaces
You must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.
Verified domain is a non-educational domain.
What workspaces are eligible?
Single-member workspace
The workspace creator’s email belongs to the verified corporate domain.
Multi-member workspace
----
The workspace creator’s email belongs to the verified corporate domain (the creator does not need to be a current member of the space).
At least one current workspace owner (either the creator or someone else) is using the verified corporate email address.
Workspace is not on the Enterprise Plan.
Once a workspace owner verifies a domain, an automated email will be sent to all workspace owners of workspaces created with that domain, notifying them that their workspaces are eligible to be claimed.
During this 14 day notification period, workspace owners can only request ownership transfers on single-member workspaces. They will be unable to delete single-member workspaces or claim multi-member workspaces.
----
After a domain is verified, users who create new workspaces with a verified domain will be notified upon creation that their workspace is eligible to be claimed.
Once a domain is verified, Enterprise workspace owners can view all non-enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain. This view can be found in your workspace security settings in theIdentity & provisioningtab under theDomain managementsection.
For each workspace, this view includes:
Workspace name
Plan type
Number of members
Workspace owners
Created at
Created by
Workspace owners can take the following actions on their claimable workspaces:
Request ownership change on single-member workspaces.
Delete single-member workspaces.
Claim multi-member workspaces.
----
Workspace owners can also export the list of claimable workspaces as a CSV.
Click onSettings & membersin your sidebar and go toIdentity & provisioning.
Click onBrowse workspacesand thenExport to CSVin the top right.
With domain management, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can request a change in ownership transfer on single-member workspaces using a verified domain to a non-corporate email address. This is especially helpful when users created a workspace using a corporate email address, but use the workspace primarily for personal projects.
----
Workspace owners need to initiate the change request in the workspace security settings. In the workspace settings, navigate to theIdentity & provisioningtab andBrowse workspacesin theDomain managementsection. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:
Select the single-member workspace that you would like to change.
In the•••menu, selectRequire account change.
Provide a contact email for questions from users about the request and confirm the action.
In the view, the workspace will enter aPendingstate.
----
When the change request is submitted, an email notification will be sent to the workspace owner of the selected workspace and the user will not be able to access their workspace until they have completed the remaining transfer steps as follows:
Log into the workspace.
Follow the instructions and change email address associated with the account to a non-corporate email address.Note: While a single-member workspace ownership change is requested, the user cannot change the email associated with their user account.
A verification code will be sent to the email address to confirm the user’s ownership of the account. Enter this verification code in the workspace.
An automated email will be sent once the change is complete.
----
Prerequisites for changing a workspace ownership
You must be a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan.
The workspace to be changed must be on a single-member.
With domain management, Enterprise workspace owners can more easily govern how a verified domain is used and where related projects are stored on Notion. When an employee leaves a company, Enterprise workspace owners can delete their single member workspaces to cleanup old content while remaining compliant.
Prerequisites for deleting a workspace
You must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.
The domain was verified at least 14 days ago.
Workspace to be deleted must be a single-member workspace that is either free or not delinquent on payments.
----
Note:Single-member workspaces that are deleted by an Enterprise workspace owner using domain management are not eligible for refunds or credits.
In the workspace settings, navigate to theIdentity & provisioningtab and selectBrowse workspacesin theDomain managementsection. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:
Select the single-member workspace you would like to delete
Click the•••menu and selectDelete workspace
Provide a contact email for questions from users about the deletion and confirm the action
----
In the workspace view, aRecoverbutton will appear next to the selected workspace. When the deletion is initiated, an email notification will be sent to the workspace owner of the selected workspace. The single member workspace owner will immediately lose access to their workspace.
Note:Enterprise workspace owner will have 30 days to recover the workspace if needed. After 30 days, the workspace will be permanently deleted automatically.
Workspace was deleted by mistake?
If you receive an email notification about a workspace that has been deleted accidentally instead of transferred, please reach out to your respective Enterprise workspace owner provided in the email notification directly.
----
Note:Only the Enterprise workspace owner who initiated the deletion can recover deleted workspaces. Notion Support cannot override Enterprise workspace owner actions to restore deleted workspaces.
To recover a deleted workspace, the Enterprise workspace owner that initiated the deletion can do this in the workspace settings: navigate to theIdentity & provisioningtab and selectBrowse workspacesin theDomain managementsection. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:
Go to the single-member workspace you would like to recover.
Click on theRecoverbutton for the workspace and confirm.
In the view the workspace will now appear without the recover button.
----
The owner of the single-member workspace will regain access to their workspace and their workspace content will be restored.
The workspace owner of the single-member workspace selected for deletion can request Notion Support extend the recovery timeframe by 30 days from the day they contact Support. After the recovery timeframe expires workspace data will be permanently deleted.
When a workspace is recovered, all page content in the workspace will be restored and the single-member workspace owner will regain access.
The following content cannot be recovered:
Favorites
Guest access
Configured integrations (Bots)
Domains (custom Notion domains)
----
With domain management, workspace owners can establish authorized workspaces for employees to collaborate by claiming ownership over eligible multi-member workspaces.
Note:If you’re on the Enterprise plan with quarterly true-ups, please work with your dedicated Account Management team to claim workspaces and bring them under your Enterprise License.
In the workspace security settings, navigate to theIdentity & provisioningtab andBrowse workspacesin theDomain managementsection. From the claimable workspaces view, complete the following steps:
Select the multi-member workspace that you would like to claim ownership.
Verify payment information (only credit card payments are supported).
----
Review and accept the billing implications of claiming the workspace.
When the claim of ownership is processed:
Claimed workspace will be upgraded to the Enterprise Plan.
Workspace owner that claimed the workspace will become the only workspace owner.
Previous workspace owners are downgraded to members (workspace owners can re-assign roles and permissions as necessary).
Prerequisites for claiming a workspace
You must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.
The domain was verified at least 14 days ago.
The claimed workspace must be multi-member.
The workspace creator’s email belongs to the verified corporate domain (the creator does not need to be a current member of the space).
----
At least one current workspace owner (either the creator or someone else) is using the verified corporate email address.
Workspace is not on the Enterprise Plan.
Note:Domain claim actions cannot be undone and are captured by the Audit Log.
Benefits of claiming a workspace
Standardize billing across Notion workspaces (all workspaces will be invoiced separately).
Configure Enterprise workspace security settings to be in compliance with your company policies.
Regulate the roles and responsibilities for the workspace (workspace owner, membership admin, member).
The workspace consolidation tool is available to Enterprise customers through their Notion Account Management team. Learn more about workspace consolidation supporthere.
----
How do I know if domain ownership verification is complete?
If domain ownership verification is complete, the verified domain will appear in a green color scheme.
My domain is displayed in red. What does this mean?
If the domain is displayed in red that means that either the domain ownership has already been verified in another workspace or the Notion-provided verification code has expired (it expires after 1 week).
To verify the domain, please restart the verification process from the beginning.
My domain is displayed in yellow. What does this mean?
If the domain is displayed in yellow, that means it’s pending validation. You need to either complete the instructions to update the DNS record or clickVerifyin the Verification modal.
----
I verified my domain in the past with the help of the Notion Support team. What will my workspace creation permissions be?
If you verified your domain before the functionality to customize permissions for workspace creation was supported, your setting will remain asAnyonecan create a workspace using your verified domain(s).
Why would I want to verify more than one domain?
If you own multiple domains – e.g. acme.com and example.com – and you plan to use SAML SSO to manage users from these domains or customize their permissions to create new workspaces, you might want to verify multiple domains.
Who is restricted from creating a workspace when the setting is Only Workspace Owners?
----
Users from your verified domain will be restricted from creating new workspaces. Only workspace owners of the workspace where the domains have been verified, will be able to create workspaces.
Where can I find a list of workspaces that have already been created using my verified domain?
This view is not yet supported. Stay tuned!
What can workspace owners do with domain management?
Domain management features help Workspace owners better control and secure their workspaces. You canconfigure SAML SSOfor your workspace, build Notion integrations usinglink previews, andcontrol who can create workspaces(for Enterprise plans only).
What is visible to workspace owners with domain management?
----
Owners of a domain will be able to see a list of workspaces that were created using the corporate domain, including information such as the list of workspace owners, number of members, and created date. They will not be able to see the content within the workspace.
What does it mean when a workspaces is in a pending state?
Once a domain claim request has been submitted, the workspace will remain in the pending state in the workspace view until the claim has been processed.
Why can’t I claim a single-member workspace? I don’t want to delete it or request an account switch.
----
Consolidating workspaces to your primary workspace is coming soon. In the meantime, you can work with the workspace owner of the single-member workspace to move content in your primary workspace.
Why can’t I delete a multi-member workspace?
Deleting a multi-member workspace is not supported in the domain management workspace view, but once you’ve successfully claimed a multi-member workspace you can follow the instructions to permanently delete the workspace as the new, sole workspace owner.
Why can’t I claim ownership of a workspace when it’s eligible to be claimed?
If your claim request is not getting processed, it’s likely that the workspace you’re trying to claim is either:
In a delinquent state on payments
----
In the 14 day waiting period after a domain is newly verified
Can I merge workspaces?
Consolidating workspaces to your primary workspace is coming soon. In the meantime, you can claim workspaces and manually move content to a primary workspace.
Can I see all workspaces created by someone from my organization?
The workspace view in your domain management settings will only show workspaces that are eligible for domain claim. Workspaces on the Enterprise Plan will not be included.
Why am I unable to delete this single-member workspace?
Workspaces may be ineligible for deletion if:
The workspace has an outstanding unpaid invoice.
The workspace is on a paid plan.
What are the single and multi-member tabs in the workspace view?
----
Domain Management functionality with Notion is based on the number of members in the workspace.
Single-member workspaces are eligible to either change ownership to a non-corporate account or delete.
Multi-member workspaces are eligible to claim.
You can provision and manage users and groups in your Notion workspace with the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) API standard 🔑

Manage your Enterprise workspace
Workspaces on the Enterprise Plan have two admin types. Here is an overview of their capabilities within the workspace:
Workspace owners can manage everything in the workspace from settings to security, members to groups — and even delete an entire workspace. They can also approve or rejectrequests to invite gueststo a workspace.
Think of them as the primary administrator of the workspace with the most expansive permissions.
Tip:We recommend you choose at least two workspace owners so there is always a backup!
Membership admins are more limited administrators who can manage user membership. They can:
Add or remove members from the workspace.
----
Note: Membership admins can add users to the workspace in amember role only. Membership admins cannot add Workspace owners or Membership admins to the workspace.
Add or remove members, Membership admins, and Workspace owners fromexistinggroups.
Membership admins cannot edit other workspace settings.

Intro to formulas
Notion formulas can perform calculations on your existing database properties and help give you better understanding of your data.
For a comprehensive tutorial on formulas and how you might use them, check out these resources:
Formula syntax & functions
How to write Notion formulas that extend the capabilities of your databases
To start writing a formula, add a formula property to your Notion database:
Click the•••menu on your database
SelectPropertiesand click+ Add a property
SelectFormula
ClickEditand begin writing your formula
Formulas 2.0
We've recently updated our formula language! Your existing formulas will be automatically migrated for this update and should behave the same.
----
For more information, check out our guide:
How to use Notion’s new and improved formulas with your existing setups
Notion’s formula syntax might look familiar if you’ve done any programming before! You’ll choosefunctions(which accomplish different tasks) andinputs(data to manipulate). Anoutput(the result) will be computed and displayed in the new formula property for every row in your database.
For example, in this formula:dateSubtract(prop("Date"), 14, "days")
The function isdateSubtract()
dateSubtract()takes in adate,number, and then a unittext, which can be"days","hours", etc.
The inputs areDate(property),14(number), and"days"(unit of time).
The output will be a date representing 14 days before yourDateproperty
----
Notion’s formula editor contains several helper features to assist in writing formulas.
The editor automatically provides suggestions of functions or properties based on what's in your formula.
You can navigate this suggestions panel withup&downarrows and useEnterto accept a suggestion.
Long formulas will wrap once you’ve exceeded the width of the editor, but you can also useShift+Enterto create a new line!
To navigate between lines, you can usealt/option + up/down.
If you open the formula editor from a database row, you'll see a live preview of the result of the formula for that row.
Note that the result preview will not display line breaks, which can be added using"\n"in the formula, e.g."Hello" + "\n" + "World"
----
The editor will display errors and highlight the erroneous code, so you can better identify the source of issues.
Formulas can manipulate and return different data types. Other property types are supported but their data type will be converted.
Text
For example,"Hello world"
Number
For example,1, -2.5
Can be displayed using the formatting options of the Formula property (e.g. as a percentage, currency, or with a ring or bar).
Date
Displays as a date with time (like August 29, 2023 1:33 PM) and can be reformatted to text using thedateFormat()function.
Dates can be date ranges, which can be constructed using thedateRange()function.
Dates cannot store seconds or milliseconds.
People
----
You can usename()oremail()to retrieve data off any People types.
Displays as people’s names with their photos.
Booleans
Can betrueorfalse.
Displays as a filled or unfilled checkbox.
Pages
Represents Notion pages, like relations.
You can retrieve the properties of a given Notion page by using.on them!
Displays as a rich page link with the page's icon.
Lists(or arrays)
Lists can hold items of any type, including more lists. Multi-select, People, Relation, and most Rollup properties will return list values.
You can use list functions likeat(),filter(),map()to manipulate lists.
Use theincludes()function to check whether these values contain a specific value instead of equality checks.
Example:prop("Tags").includes("Movie")
----
List items display comma-separated for texts, numbers, and dates. For people, checkboxes, and pages, they display space-separated.
Empty
The empty value is not displayed in the output of a formula property, but can be used in the computations themselves.
You can check for emptyness on any piece of data with theempty()function.
For example,toNumber("")orparseDate("Not a date")will returnEmpty.
Notion formulas can operate on various properties and functions. Here, you'll find a list of them ➗

10 AI prompts to help marketers write better copy, faster
Marketing your business involves consistently sharing fresh, interesting content across different channels.
Notion AI can help you dream up endless content ideas and craft engaging posts for all your channels. Brainstorm, outline, write, and edit any kind of text, and never worry about running out of things to say to your audience.
In this guide, you’ll discover 10 AI prompts for writing marketing copy.
If blog posts are the core of your content strategy, you’ll know how cumbersome it can be to outline, write and edit articles on a regular basis.
But with Notion AI, you’ll be able to write and publish blog posts in a fraction of the time it usually takes.
----
Kick off the process with an AI-powered brainstorming session. Hit the spacebar on a new line to summon AI, then scroll down toBrainstorm ideasin theDraft with AImenu. Ask for blog post ideas about your chosen topic, and then tell Notion AI to create an outline for you.
Once you have an outline on your page, you can select theBlog postoption and start writing with a prompt like:
Draft a blog post based on [the outline above] about [topic], and include [step-by-step instructions] in each section
Once you have a draft, edit with AI by highlighting any section of text and asking AI to continue writing, check spelling and grammar, adjust the tone of voice, and more.
----
Combining the power of AI with your brand’s unique perspective, you’ll be able to write blog posts that are ready to post in a fraction of the usual time.
Publishing social media posts every day is essential to keep your audiences engaged and your brand top of mind for your followers, but it can be challenging to think of new content ideas every day.
One of the best ways to use AI for social media posts is to ask for a series of social media posts based on another piece of content, like a blog post.
Try the following prompt on a page containing a blog post draft:
----
Create a series of 10 [LinkedIn] posts based on the content of [this article]. Make the posts eye-catching and engaging to B2B decision-makers, so they feel motivated to request a demo.
AI can also help you write captions for your Instagram posts if you explain the content of the image or video and what you want to talk about in the caption.
To compose your weekly newsletter with AI, start by creating a newsletter template in your content calendar. In that template, outline your newsletter with sections you normally include (updates, learnings, recommendations, etc.) and add bullet points underneath each heading.
Then, at the top of the page, add aCustom AI blockwith a prompt like:
----
Write another edition of the newsletter using the outline and information below.
Every week, generate a newsletter from the template, fill out some information in the bullet points then ask Notion AI to write the latest edition for you.
Whether you’re building a website from scratch or updating your existing copy, use Notion AI to generate several different versions of the copy and choose the best options.
You can paste existing copy from your website into Notion or write a very rough draft of what you need to say.
Then, ask Notion AI to come up with several versions of the copy. Make sure to include the purpose of the text, which benefits you want to highlight, and what the call to action should be:
Here is an example prompt to try:
----
Create several [shorter] versions of the text below. Make it sound [exciting], [persuasive] and include the benefits of [signing up for a free trial]
Once you have a few options, select the ones you like best and ask Notion AI to create some more. You can edit and refine your favorite results until you’re happy with them.
Writing video scripts is different from other content because your writing will be read aloud. You probably want it to sound more conversational, however, you still need to convey information clearly.
To write a video script with Notion AI, provide as much information about the topic as possible in the prompt, especially if the video will be something like a product tour or tutorial.
Here’s a sample prompt you could use:
----
Write a script for a video tutorial using a casual, conversational tone explaining step by step how to do [x]. Highlight the following three features: [feature 1, 2, and 3] plus their benefits
With Notion AI, you can turn a customer interview into a case study effortlessly.
Start by pasting a transcript of the customer interview into your Notion page. Now, ask Notion AI to write a case study based on the text. You can do this with a custom AI block, or just by opening the AI menu and typing a custom prompt.
Turn this customer interview into a case study. Use quotes from the interview above. Explain how we were able to solve the customer’s problem and take them [from A to B] / [achieve [x] result]
----
If you store user feedback or customer stories in a database, you can also useAI autofill propertyto extract insights or get a quick summary of the results.
Writing a white paper can seem like a huge undertaking, but Notion AI can help you turn your data or survey results into an easily digestible downloadable resource.
TheAI autofill propertylets you apply Notion AI to entire databases, and this could be helpful when creating a white paper.
Compile all your data or survey results into a Notion database, and add a new property. There are three AI Autofill properties that generate text based on the contents of a page: Summary, Key insights, or Custom.
In aCustom AI property, try prompting AI to:
----
Summarize this page and generate 1-3 of the most noteworthy insights
Your press releases likely follow a familiar format. Just like the newsletter, you can create a database template to outline press releases in your content database.
Create a new template in the database and add a custom AI block instructing Notion AI to write a press release based on the information on the page.
Elsewhere on the template page, you can write a press release outline and writing guidelines. Every time you need to write a press release, create a new page from the template and add additional information about the features or updates you want to announce.
Use the following prompt:
----
Write a press release according to the [outline] and [press release writing guidelines] below, about the information in the [update] section.
To write product descriptions with Notion AI, first create a table database with all your products. Include as much information as possible about each product, and you can also paste in existing descriptions from your website if you have them.
You could generate new product descriptions by using a custom AI autofill property, or a custom AI block inside the page.
Either way, prompt Notion AI to write the product description based on the page information and specific instructions regarding the style and tone of voice you want.
Here’s a sample prompt:
----
Write a product description. Explain succinctly what [this product] does and how it benefits users, in [less than 100 words]. The tone of voice should be [witty], [light-hearted], [aspirational], but [practical].
If you’re running paid ads, you’ll know that getting the copy on point can increase your conversions.
But sometimes, you don’t know what will work best until you’ve tried it.
Notion AI can generate several variations of ad copy until you find something that resonates. You can even try out several versions to see which ones get the best results.
Here’s a prompt for writing ad copy with AI:
----
Write copy for a [channel] ad, explaining [product]. We want people to [sign up for a free trial]. Make sure to highlight [benefit 1] and [benefit 2]. 20-30 words maximum. Generate 10 variations.

5 AI prompts to surface fresh insights from your databases
Your databases are packed with information, and you can quickly bring the most valuable insights to the surface using Notion’s AI autofill property.
Bringing the time-saving efficiency and creative enhancement of Notion AI into your databases makes it easier to parse large sets of data and get the key takeaways from every page at once.
This guide will show you:
How to add an AI autofill property and customize it
5 custom prompts and how to use them in different situations
More specific prompt ideas to spark your creativity
----
Databases allow you to aggregate pages and categorize them using properties. As you gather more and more information, it’s helpful to get a high-level summary of what pages contain, without having to open each item one by one.
By asking AI to generate a summary of the page content, you’ll get a quick a heads-up about what a page is about, the information it contains, and whether it’s complete or lacking information.
SelectingAI summaryfrom the properties menu automatically summarizes all your database entries. However, if you want to be more specific about the style and length of your summary, add an AI custom autofill property.
Try the following custom prompt:
Summarize the content of this page in one short sentence
----
Adjust the prompt if you want AI to summarize the content in three words, in bullet points, or to summarize in simple terms.
Get a simple summary of a technical document— Use the AI custom property to summarize a technical document like a product or feature spec in simpler language so non-technical team members and collaborators can understand it at a glance.
Summarize drafts in your content calendar— Add a custom property to your content calendar to summarize blog articles, social media posts or ebooks.
Generate a summary of resources you’ve saved— If you’re using Notion’s web clipper to save interesting articles or posts into your library, an AI summary property can produce a helpful summary.
----
You can use a custom autofill property to scan your pages for potential action items. This surfaces things you or your team may need to do, prevents tasks from getting missed or forgotten, and saves you from trawling through lengthy documents to search for tasks manually.
Use the following prompt:
Search this page for action items and create a bulleted list of tasks we need to do
Use this to:
Break out tasks to do from a project brief— If you’ve created a scope doc or brief for a project, the autofill property will be able to scan the page for potential tasks using the above prompt. You can easily view them along with the project brief, or add them straight to your tasks database.
----
Extract action items from meeting notes— After you finish taking notes in your Meetings database, you can use the AI autofill property to extract potential tasks to-do from those notes, ensuring nothing you’ve discussed will get forgotten or missed.
Create a daily to-do list from a journal entry— If you journal in Notion, you can automatically scan your entries for tasks you need to do, and use this as your daily to-do list.
Quickly get the most important takeaway of any database page with a custom prompt to extract key themes and insights.
You can ask Notion AI to assess the overall theme, mood, or sentiment of a page.
Try the following prompt:
Create a numbered list of the three main takeaways from this page
----
Alternatively, you can try asking Notion to “Explain this page in three words” or “Describe the overall mood or sentiment of the page content.”
This comes in handy when you want to:
Quickly assess the sentiment of survey results— In a database with survey results or user feedback, you can use this prompt to gauge the overall sentiment of each response.
Get the main takeaways from a research paper or study— Discover the key findings of lengthy research or scientific paper before you dive in to read the whole thing.
Discover common themes from a brainstorming session— After running a brainstorming workshop and documenting the process in a Notion database, Notion AI autofill can provide some insight about what topics came up repeatedly.
----
Pull deadlines from a page— If your page mentions tasks or milestones, you can customize the prompt to scan for impending deadlines.
Easily categorize content drafts or ideas— If you’re drafting content in Notion, you can use AI autofill to categorize each piece. You can adjust the prompt to something like “Categorize this page according to its key topics.”
Risks or blockers that go unnoticed can derail your projects, but AI can automatically catch any roadblocks before they become a problem for you or your team.
Try the following prompt:
Search this page for any potential problems, risks, or blockers that may prevent progress, and list them briefly
Some examples of when to use this:
----
Make everyone aware of tasks that are blocking progress— A task can’t be completed until several sub-tasks are done. This property makes it clear what needs to happen first.
Flag missing information so you can move forward— During a client call, you discussed needing to find a time to meet. However, you weren’t able to find a mutually suitable time. Your AI autofill property can detect this from your meeting notes.
Highlight risks or requirements of a project— In a project plan or product spec, you can use AI autofill to search for risk factors that may affect whether the project is viable, for example, capabilities, resources, and amount of time required.
----
Whether you’re managing client projects or setting yourself personal goals, defining key progress milestones can help to keep you on track.
Try using a custom AI prompt like the one below:
Suggest some possible milestones for this project/goal
This can be useful to:
Define milestones for a project to present to your client— When you’re planning a client project, you can easily outline some likely milestones.
Measure your progress towards a goal— You’ve set yourself some goals and are tracking them in a Notion database. Your custom AI property will suggest relevant milestones so you can measure your progress.
----
The 5 examples above are general prompts that you can customize further according to your specific requirements. Experiment with the wording of your prompts to get the results you want, and, for the best results, be specific about the desired length and format of the response.
Here are a few more ideas for different ways to use the AI autofill property:
List out recipe ingredients in your meal prep database— Create an AI autofill property to list ingredients in your meal planning database. As you add new recipe ideas, you’ll automatically get a handy list of ingredients.
----
Automatically categorize database items— If you’d like to add helpful tags to your favorite recipes (vegetarian, vegan, contains nuts, gluten-free), you can use an AI autofill property to categorize them. You can also do this to categorize your digital bookshelf or movie database according to genre.
Create a shopping list for your home renovation project— Planning to renovate your bathroom or kitchen? Draft a project plan in your household projects database (or get Notion AI to help you write one) and then prompt an AI autofill property to generate a shopping list for the project.
----
Generate a book synopsis— With the Notion web clipper, you can quickly add books to your reading list. Add a custom AI property to summarize the content of the page you’ve saved, which could be a synopsis of the book from Goodreads. When you want to dive into your next book, this context will help you decide what to read.
Custom AI database properties produce a text response to a prompt based on each page’s content and properties.
All you have to do is add the AI autofill property to the database, write your prompt, and Notion AI will generate dynamic text.
To add an AI autofill property to your database:
Go to the options menu…and selectProperties
Click+ New property
Choose one of the three AI property options from the menu.

5 steps to adopt Notion for your entire organization
Ready to get your team collaborating in a connected Notion workspace?
As you or your IT partners are starting to develop your Notion rollout plan, you might be wondering what you need to do to get everything up and running.
In this guide, we’ll explain the 5 steps of bringing Notion to your organization — from workspace set-up, to ongoing maintenance. Each section contains a brief overview of what to do, plus links to more detailed guides that provide you with step-by-step instructions.
This guide will help you:
Understand how to prepare your company to successfully adopt Notion
Import content into Notion for a consolidated work experience
----
Find all the team enablement resources you need in one place
Spending some time to establish the architecture of your workspace will help you organize your information in a logical way, so team members can find what they’re looking for and know where to go to contribute their work.
----
First you’ll need tocreate your Notion workspace. Once that’s done, nominate some of your team members to become Workspace owners, who will be responsible for getting to grips with Notion’s security and permissions settings, understanding the different types of users (and how to set them up), and billing. Usually, this will be someone from your company’s IT department who is working on security and permissions, plus your team leads or knowledge managers who will help to add content.
With IT setup underway, you can start structuring the workspace by dividing it into teamspaces. These are sections of the workspace that belong to departments of your company, which give each team a home for their work.
----
Most organizations begin with a “General” teamspace for everyone, then create teamspaces for each department. Your general teamspace will be home to company-wide knowledge like docs, and meeting notes, while team-specific teamspaces tend to house project trackers, and custom workflows.
Check out these examples ofwikisthat store team knowledge, and custom project trackers like thiscontent calendarorproduct roadmap.

----
A successful, organization-wide implementation includes thinking deeply about how you and other teams will work together. Consider what Notion use cases will be most beneficial to your team — project tracking, knowledge management, or documentation — and start creating those pages. If you’re not sure exactly what goes in Notion, read through our guide onwhere Notion fits into your company’s tool ecosystem.
As a Notion owner within your org, we generally recommend focusing on your company-wide and general use-cases, and assigning specific owners for team-based workflows. This step is probably the right time to start bringing those folks into the conversation.
----
There are two ways to get up and running with content quickly: import content from another tool, or use templates.
You can import content from other tools directly into Notion, so you can pick up right where you left off.
First, connect and verify your accounts in the Settings menu, then open the Import menu in your sidebar, choose the tool you want to import from and follow the instructions.

Additionally, explore our Template gallery for ready-to-use systems for any need — from generic docs and notes to bespoke solutions for your team.
Once you find what you want in the Template gallery, duplicate the page into the relevant teamspace, then customize them as needed to suit your team.

As you start to get your team members into Notion, you’ll want to make the process of adapting as smooth as possible.
Here are some things you can do to help your team learn and adjust to Notion:
Explain how Notion fits into your tool stack— Team members will need to understand how Notion connects to the rest of their tools. Your job is to show them the use cases, the value and why it’s different and better from what they do today.
----
Create an onboarding page— Send your team members to an onboarding page which contain all the resources they’ll need to get started, like videos and guides to cover the basics. To start, check out the resources below.
Encourage experimentation in private pages— Folks can use the private section of the workspace to experiment with creating pages, inserting Notion blocks and playing around with databases.
Introduce collaborative features— Invite others to pages and projects. Start tagging people and commenting. This will start to create the flywheel of collaboration. Share things inside of Notion, and outside of it, in your messaging tools.
----
Make sure onboarding is successful by giving your team members all the information they need to use Notion confidently.
Get everyone to complete Notion Academy— Start with Notion 101, and go from there.
Measure progress with onboarding checklists— Give people an incentive to go through all the onboarding materials and measure their progress.
Make it interactive— Instead of a page of text, your onboarding page can include embedded videos, a gallery of resources and you can include your own tutorial videos showing how to use your workspace.
Resources for onboarding your team to Notion

----
Collaboration is the heart of Notion, and as team members join the workspace, you’ll need to ensure everyone has the right level of access to the content they need and can contribute to their team’s work. At the same time, you’ll want to limit the number of people who can make significant changes to the workspace, like adding new members and changing security settings.
There are four types of users in Notion -Workspace owners(who have full access to the workspace and security settings),Membership admins(Enterprise plan only),MembersandGuests.
----
Workspace owners will be responsible for user management and provisioning access to content. Access can also be adjusted at page level. There are four levels of page access:Full access,Can edit,Can comment, andCan view.
Notion offers Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality for Business and Enterprise users, enhancing security and simplifying access management.
SAML SOO is available for workspaces on Notion’s Business or Enterprise Plans.

Remember those teamspace owners you assigned in step 2? This is their time to shine. Once your teams are in place, you’ll want to start the process of building team-specific workflows, and connecting specialist tools to get the most out of your workspace.
----
There are endless ways for teams to use Notion, but these are some of the most common use cases:
Manage projects and tasks seamlessly— With Notion’s integrated Projects & tasks system, teams can track daily work and larger projects effortlessly.
Connect docs and meeting notes— Use Notion databases to create and organize your documentation and take notes for every meeting. You can then connect information to the relevant project.
Grow your team’s knowledge base— Build a knowledge base where team members can find all the information they need about the company and their role.
----
There’s a good chance that even if you have several use cases for Notion, there may be certain other tools that team members want to keep using — either because some teams need specialist tools for their work, or because they are planning to migrate to Notion at a later date.
The good thing is that you can continue to use any specialist tools, while at the same time connecting all of your work to Notion.
For example:
Add link previews that give everyone context— When you paste a link into Notion, you have the option toPaste as preview, which gives a visualization of the content from the URL, which provides context.
----
Create synced databases that contain up-to-date information— Pull an entire database worth of content from tools like Github and Jira into a Notionsynced databasethat’s updated in real time.
Use connected properties in your databases— Link Google Drive files, Figma files andGitHub pull requestsin your Notion database through special connected properties.
Integrate with Slack for easier team communication— If your team uses Slack to communicate, you canintegrate Slack with Notionto send automatic notifications and paste Slack messages into your pages.
Once you’ve got your team using Notion, here are some best practices to make sure everyone gets the most out of the tool.
----
Prevent the workspace getting messy and make sure content stays up to date and relevant.
Assign page owners and use verification— You can turn your company knowledge base into a wiki which gives it extra features, like page verification. Page owners can mark a page as verified to signal that the content is fresh.
Organize the sidebar— An untidy sidebar makes it difficult for team members to find what they need. Make sure the sidebar is organized and each team’s pages are contained in their teamspace.
Use theSearchfeature— Team members can use theSearchfunction to find pages and information easily.
Continuously onboard —When new teammates join your company, invite them to your Notion workspace and give them a tour using the resources above
----
Check out new features —Keep an eye on our “What’s new” page to incorporate new features and connections as they’re released, and share key features with your teammates to encourage deeper Notion use.
Fine-tune team and workspace settings— It’s best to start simple on permissions, but as you grow, use permission settings to prevent unwanted edits to content and make sure information is safeguarded. Check out ourscaling your team courseto learn more.

5 ways to get more value out of your reading list with Notion AI
Notion databases let you collect and categorize a variety of information in helpful ways, and AI can help you get more value from that content and apply the learnings to your work, life, or studies.
Using Notion AI and AI autofill properties, you can automatically surface useful insights and key takeaways at a glance, so you’ll remember more and take action.
In this guide, you’ll learn 5 Notion AI tricks to get more value from your documents and resources.
With Notion’sWeb Clipper, you can save any web page to your workspace to read or edit later.
----
The clipper brings text, images, and media right into your database page, helping you quickly grow your reading list or collect references, and consume content without leaving Notion.
When you combine this with an AI summary property, you can get a high-level overview of each saved resource, just from a quick glance at the database.
Add theAI Summaryproperty to your database for an automatic summary. For a more specific output, select aCustom AI autofillproperty and write your own prompt — for example, ask AI to summarize in three words, one sentence, 3 bullet points, etc.
The benefits of automatic summaries:
----
Speed up research for your next project— As you collect resources to research for a project, a summary gives you a quick overview of what each source contains so you can prioritize the most helpful content.
Get the gist of dozens of news articles on the same topic— Easily understand the nuances and angles of various sources covering one topic.
Filter through your recipes or travel suggestions faster— An automatic summary helps you scan through your recipes or destinations database and find what’s most relevant.
If you’re working with any kind of technical documents, like product feature specs or scientific research papers, Notion AI can produce a simplified version of the text that’s easier to understand.
----
To do this, highlight the text you want to simplify, open theAsk AImenu, and selectSimplify language. Alternatively, add a Custom AI block to your page and prompt AI to generate a simplified version of page content. If you create a custom block in your database page template, it will be there every time you create a new document from that template.
When you simplify text, you can keep the original content and insert the simplified version above. This helps make information easier to digest and more accessible, especially if you’re collaborating with others.
Simplifying complex documents will help you:
----
Collaborate with non-technical teams— Make it easier for non-technical team mates or collaborators to understand content without getting confused by technical language
Filter out technical jargon— Complex terminology can obscure meaning of a text. Notion AI can help replace jargon with more everyday language.
If you want to generate a specific response based on page content, you can design your own custom AI prompt. Add a Custom AI autofill property to your database, write your prompt, and the results will display as a database property.
You can ask Notion AI to:
List everyone mentioned on a page— Notion AI can surface any names mentioned in your page as a property - try prompting your custom AI property as follows:
----
List out every person mentioned on this page
Provide 3 key insights or takeaways from a page— Ask Notion AI for key takeaways from a research paper, or insights from a brainstorming session in the format of a bulleted list.
Make a list of 3 key takeaways or insights from this research
Search for a daily highlight— If you’re journalling in Notion, ask AI to surface your highlight of the day.
Generate a highlight of the day from the page content
Generate milestones for your goals— Track your goals in a Notion database and use an AI autofill property to set appropriate milestones to help measure your progress.
Suggest possible milestones to help me reach this goal
----
Extract action items from notes— You can extract tasks to do from meeting notes, journal entries or project pages, so nothing gets missed.
Find all action items mentioned in this meeting note

Plowing through lots of resources can be draining, especially if you’re not reading in your native language.
You can automatically translate all or part of any page content into many different languages using Notion AI.
To do this, add aCustom AI blockto the page, or database template. Prompt AI to translate the page content into your chosen language.
----
If you don’t want to translate the entire page, you can add aCustom AI Autofillproperty, and ask Notion AI to create a summary or list of key takeaways in your language.
So, even if you’ve saved a web page that’s in English, you can ask Notion AI to:
Provide the 3 key insights from this page in Spanish
Translating in Notion will help you:
Reduce context-switching that breaks your focus— Instead of going to a new tab to translate text, you have a translator built into your workspace.
Remove friction or barriers to understanding— With the power to translate words, sections or entire pages at once, information becomes more accessible to all.
----
With Notion AI, you’ll never run out of things to read — you can use a Custom AI autofill property to recommend similar content.
For example, if you’re tracking your reading in Notion, you can ask for book, movie, blog, and podcast recommendations based on content you’ve saved.

Create streamlined project management workflows using database automations
As a project manager (or anyone who manages work), you might be inundated with repetitive tasks — updating project statuses, adding and assigning new tasks, sending out reminders, and so on, all the way from project kickoff to sign-off.
The manual workload increases as your team grows, but with Notion these tedious tasks can become database automations you set and forget.
In this guide, we’ll show you how to use database automations to set up custom workflows to streamline your processes and make sure nothing slips through the cracks.
----
Database automations consist of trigger events and the sequence of actions that follows. You’ll set up triggers and subsequent actions which are based on changes within database properties. The automation is structured as follows: “When any of these occur (a trigger), do this (an action).
So, for example, your trigger could be when a new page is added to the database, and the resulting actions might fill up some properties with your chosen responses.
Database automations can complete or update properties, add or edit pages in another database, send Slack notifications, and more. You can customize automations as needed and have several running in the same database for different scenarios.
----
While this feature is available in any Notion database, it’s uniquely powerful in the context of project management, where you need accurate workflows where nothing gets lost, missed, or forgotten.
By creating database automations, you can:
Reduce wasted time between tasks— Instead of your team members waiting around to be assigned their next project, they’ll be notified whenever something new lands on their plate.
Prevent human error— When your team is juggling multiple projects, it’s often the manual tasks (like re-assigning a task) that get forgotten. Setting up automations will reduce everyone’s cognitive load and prevent anything from getting missed.
----
Consolidate project management— Because database automations are native to Notion, you don’t need to create complex workflows using third-party tools. You can do all your project management in Notion to keep your team focused and reduce context-switching.
Database automations are only available on some plan types
Click to expand
You can set up database automations in a few simple steps.
In your projects or tasks database:
Go to the options menu … and selectAutomationsor just click on the lightning bolt icon.
ChooseNew automationand rename it if you wish.
----
Next, select your triggers, which can be when a new page is added, a certain property (or properties) are edited, orAny propertyis edited. Triggers are formatted as “or” statements, so if any one of the triggers occurs, the automation will occur.
Choose the resulting actions, such as adding a new page to this database or another database, editing a property (in this database or another), send a Slack notification.
ClickCreateto save the automation.
Anytime you want to edit your automations, come back to the menu and make your changes.
Choose which pages your automation will apply to

Here are some helpful examples to try out in your projects and tasks databases.
----
Every time you add a new task to your database, you can assign that task to someone, send them a notification, and give it the correct status.
To do this, create a new task and call it something like “New task flow”. Go to+ Add triggerand select+ Page added.
In the+ Add actionmenu, give all new pages the statusNot Started, and select a team member to assign them to. Finally, click Send Slack notification to and choose who you want to notify.
Now, whenever you add a new task, you’ll see all those properties are completed, and a Slack notification is sent.
Editing Slack notifications
Click to expand
To simplify the process of kicking off a project, you can create aProject kickoffautomation in your Projects database.
----
The trigger will be when a project’s status is changed fromNot startedtoUp next, and the actions that follow will automatically schedule a project kickoff meeting and notify the project manager.
In the Actions menu, selectAdd page toand find the meeting notes database. Call the new pageProject Kickoffand clickEdit another propertyto tag all team members and set the meeting date toToday, which will be the current date whenever the workflow is triggered. Finally, we can send a Slack notification to the project manager to alert them that the project is about to kick off.
Project managers can sign off a project with one click using this automation.
----
First, add a checkbox property to your projects database and call it something likeSign off. Next, create an automation where the trigger is an update to the sign-off property.
When you select the checkbox, you can then change theStatusof all related tasks to complete, notify your team’s Slack channel and update theCompleted datetoToday.
There are infinite ways to build efficient workflows across your entire workspace with database automations.

Who should be a workspace member, and who should be a guest?
A collaborative workspace where everyone has the right access to the content is the modern way of working. However, as an admin, you want to allocate your team’s budget responsibly and avoid using more paid seats than you need, while still ensuring everyone has the right tools to do their job.
Understanding the difference between members and guests will help you decide who you should invite to join your workspace.
This guide will explain:
Key differences between members and guests in your workspace
Who should be a member, and who should be a guest
How to manage member and guest settings
----
Members are most likely to be people from your organization who’ll have access to the majority of the content in the workspace.
People at your company need to become workspace members so they can effectively collaborate, share content, create and edit pages, and access all the information relevant to their role.
Members can:
Have workspace-wide access— They will have some level of access to the majority of content, even if it’s only to read or comment, except for private content and any pages that have been restricted.
----
Belong to groups and teamspaces— You can add workspace members to groups and invite them to teamspaces. Members can also join any open teamspaces. Inside a teamspace, members can easily find information relevant to their role and create docs alongside their team mates.
Create new pages and teamspaces— Members can create pages in any area they have access to, and add new teamspaces.
Work on private pages— Members have aPrivatesection in the sidebar where they can create private pages. When they’re ready to share more broadly, all they have to do is move these pages to the right teamspace.
Share pages and adjust page settings— Sharing pages with people or groups and publishing pages to the web is possible for members with full access.
----
There are different types of Notion workspace members:
Workspace owners can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage fellow admins, members, and guests.
Membership admins only exist on Enterprise plans. They can add or remove members to the workspace or groups but do not have access to workspace settings.
Members are the rest of your colleagues who can create and edit Notion pages but don’t have access to workspace settings.
Teamspaces help teams organize important work
Click to expand
There are a few things to consider when deciding whether to make someone a workspace member.
----
Firstly, you’ll be billed per member on paid plans. So, you don’t want to pay a member’s seat for someone who only works with you on a short-term or project basis.
Instead, members should be people who’ll need to regularly sign in and access a lot of workspace content.
Examples of workspace members include:
Everyone on your team— Make everyone on your team a member so they can access wikis, tasks, and work collaboratively to plan and execute projects.
Your manager, and their manager— Managers should be workspace members so they can have full visibility into their team’s work and wider company goals and initiatives.
----
Your agency partners— Long-term partners can become members, however they may only need access to one teamspace, not the entire workspace.
Long-term contractors—You may want to invite some contractors and freelancers to become members if they work with you long-term and need access to several different areas of the workspace.
Temporary staff and interns— Depending on their scope of work, temporary staff and interns might need to become members. You can remove them from the workspace when their contract finishes.
How to add members to your workspace
Click to expand
Guests will likely be external collaborators who aren’t employees of your organization, working with you on specific projects, often on a short-term basis.
----
You’ll invite guests to the workspace on a page-by-page basis, and they won’t have access to the entire workspace.
When you invite a guest to a page, they can view sub-pages automatically. However, you can adjust the settings of these pages to restrict access if needed.
Guests can’t:
Create pages outside the content they’re invited to— They can only create sub-pages nested in the shared page.
Join teamspaces or groups— You can’t add a guests to groups or invite them to a teamspace.
Guests in your workspace might include:
Freelancers and contractors— In most cases, you won’t need to add freelancers and contractors as members, because they’ll probably only need access to limited content which you can add to a shared page.
----
Clientsof your agency—Inviting clients to your workspaces as guests is a convenient way to share projects and drafts. You can create a client portal home page which contains everything they’ll need to review.
A mentor, coach or family member— If you want feedback on a document, such as your personal development plan, you could invite a friend or mentor to view the page as a guest.
If you want to share a page with a guest, you can go to theSharemenu on the page you want to share.
ClickInvite, enter the email address of the person you want to invite, choose their access level, and selectInvite.
The guest will then receive an email with a link to the page.
----
If you want to adjust your guest’s access level, you can return to theSharemenu and select an option from the dropdown.
In theMemberssection ofSettings & members, you’ll see a tab forGuests.
Here, you’ll find all the pages each guest has access to. You can convert guests to members and remove them from the workspace here.
Yourplanlimits the number of guests you can invite, so remember to remove guests who no longer need access.
Workspace owners can adjust invite settings in the Security section of the workspace settings. Here, you can choose whether members can invite guests directly, via guest request, or completely disable guests.
----
If guest requests are enabled, Workspace owners will be able to invite guests directly, but everyone else will have to create a guest request and wait for this to be approved by a Workspace owner.
Workspace owners can enable guest requests to have more control over who views company content, and to ensure the workspace doesn’t surpass its guest limit.

A guide to connecting projects and meeting notes
In Notion, you can link together different projects, meeting notes, tasks, and associated documents for easy access.
This is done by connecting different databases in Notion, which allows team members to quickly find all relevant pages.
To do this, add a new property in any Notion database, and select the Relation property, and choose the database you’d like to connect.
For instance, you could connect your Projects database with your Tasks and Meeting Notes databases, and hence connect any project to their associated tasks and meeting notes.

A project management system for your design team that connects all your work
A solid project management system gives designers more time to do impactful work. Instead of worrying about checkins and checkpoints and checkboxes, your team can spend time actually, you know, designing.
Here, we'll show you step-by-step how to build aproject management systemtailored specifically to designers in Notion.We've seen it work across dozens of design teams. They're using it to take cross-functional projects to completion, foster tighter feedback loops and lead to a better end product for users.
Better databases have arrived!
----
While the concepts outlined in this guide are still useful, references to specific product actions may be a bit outdated! Databases were redesigned in March 2022, so your experience may differ slightly from what’s pictured and described here.This guideoutlines the new database features, including what's changed.
To create a database for project management and roadmapping that's efficient and transparent.
To organize this database with tags and views so you can quickly find what you need.
Best practices from the Notion design team for supreme project management.
Soon, you'll be able to create a project management system for all things design that looks like this:
From a project management standpoint, designers face a unique set of problems.
----
Too many tools— it's easy to lose files, re-do work and waste time when designers need to turn over many rocks to find the one thing they need.
Processes get inconsistent— from problem to ideation to multiple drafts, your team is devaluing their design work if steps are missed and edge cases aren't considered. This is especially critical as your team grows.
Many voices in feedback loops— design teams work cross-functionally, and if there isn't a place to collect and act on feedback, it gets lost and other teams feel as though their opinions aren't taken into account.
In Notion, you can create a project management system that is completely customizable for your team's needs.
----
All tools, project work and feedback in one place— in Notion pages, you can embed Figma and Framer prototypes, Invision designs, images, video and more. Plus, comments and discussions happen in these pages. So along with tracking project statuses, everything relevant to that project has a home, which means your team can quickly access it.
Establish a process and track every step of a project— from simple logo development to complex overhauls of your entire design system, you can create a process that works for your team, and every project can be moved from one stage to the next with complete visibility.
----
Surface only relevant information— with many steps and nuanced processes, there can be a lot of noise when managing every single aspect of a design project. Notion lets you slice the same database many different ways, so you can see projects by designer or what's launching this week (or however else you want to see it).
So, how does this help your team?
Notion enables your design team to grow by setting a consistent process that still maintains quality work — all while fostering a culture of transparency.
Projects large and small — and all the teams contributing to these projects — can live in your one project management system. Here's how to set it up, with recommendations specific to designers.
----
There are a handful of different databases you can make in Notion: tables, calendars, lists, boards, etc. Here, we'll focus on a board — this is a collection of individual project pages you can move from one stage of your process to the next.
Hit/to see a menu of everything you can add to a Notion page. This is called the "slash command," and it's the starting place for just about everything you do in Notion.
To make a board, type/boardand chooseBoard - Full page. You'll make a new page that's just your board.
You'll see columns at the top of your board. These will be steps in your design process. Go ahead and change them to whatever you'd like — for example, "Not started," "Next up," "In progress," and "Completed."
----
You'll also see cards, which will be home to your design projects. Click one and you'll see properties at the top. Click+ Add a propertyto begin adding your own (and select what type of property you want). You can add things like the lead designer, designate a project as mobile or desktop, and a launch date. These are important because you'll be able to organize your board based on these properties.
Grab a card and move it from one column to the next. Ah...no better feeling than progress.
----
Each part of the board serves a purpose in your design project management system.Columns will help you establish a process everyone follows. Cards will become design projects, like that typography redesign you've been meaning to do. And inside those cards will be everything you need for each project.
With everything in one place, designers can stop bouncing between apps — instead, focusing on the work at hand.
Using Notion, you can make a database that matches your team's workflow. Here are some tips for designers setting up their project management system.
----
Add properties to your cards— inside your board's cards, you'll see properties. These are attributes you'll assign to each card, like the type of project or the designer responsible for it. Click on a property and you'll see a menu for thePROPERTY TYPE. Use aPersonproperty to assign a designer (or project owner). Use aSelectproperty and call it "Type" to denote the type of project, like ads, web or mobile. Use aDateproperty to select a ship date. You can add or remove as many properties as you'd like — so as your team changes or your process evolves, Notion grows with you.
----
Show properties on your cards— to get a 10,000 ft. view of all the types of projects your team is working on, who's executing them, and their statuses, display certain properties directly on your cards. That way, you'll be able to see them in the board view (instead of needing to click into the specific card). At the top right of your table, hit•••and selectProperties. You'll then be able to toggle the properties you want to see in the board view. You can even grab the⋮⋮icon to re-order how they're shown on the cards.
----
Change the grouping of your board— instead of seeing projects by their status, you might want to see them by priority, or see how many projects each designer has on their plate. On the upper right of your board, you'll see aGroup bybutton. This changes the columns in the board to any property that's aSelect,Multi-selectorPerson.
----
Create different views— Notion allows you to view the same dataset many ways. Maybe you want to see all the projects related to landing pages, or maybe you want a calendar of launch dates. To do this, hit+ Add a viewnext to the title of your table, select the type of database you want, give it a name and hitCreate. You can then apply different filters and sorts to customize it further. Let's say you want a list of all the mobile projects your designers are working on. Create a list view, then selectFilterand then+ Add a filter. If you have a property that denotes the type of design work, choose "Mobile” and now, only mobile projects will be in your list. You can also selectSort, then+ Add a sort. Here, you can organize cards by priority, due date and more.
----

With this project management system, you're essentially creating a multi-tool that's customizable to meet your design team's needs. It's one database that can be used for many different purposes — from a list organizing all your landing page designs, to a calendar that shows when those designs will launch.

Since you now have the framework for managing projects, let's explore how each page can help you collect and organize all the work related to your projects.
----
Like artists, designers use a unique combination of tools to get the job done. Notion consolidates them. No need to juggle design tools and the project management software just to get one thing done.
Custom pages for every project— designers on your team probably work differently. No matter. The body of every Notion page can be used however they want, while still living inside the structure of your project management system. By typing/headingyou can create headers to neatly organize info, making it easy to find and understand. You can drag-and-drop anything using the⋮⋮icon, like images, text, videos, whatever. Consider making columns for an even cleaner look by dragging blocks all the way to the right.
----
Embeds just for designers— Notion allows you to embed many different types of files right into your project pages. Of course, there's videos, images and PDFs. But you can also embed Figma or Invision projects to see live drafts of website mockups. Collaborate with the UX team on an app redesign by embedding Framer prototypes. In the final review of a logo change, an embedded Whimsical or Miro board could have a flowchart showing your designer's thought process. Access these by simply typing/and the name, like/figmaor/miro.
----
Feedback from all teams in one place— design work is so cross-functional, you may be collaborating with engineers or getting approval from the head of marketing. Use the@symbol to mention one of your teammates and keep the feedback loop tight. This can be done at the top of any page by hovering over the title and clickingAdd discussion, or you can hover over any block to bring up the⋮⋮icon, and hitCommentfrom that menu. Collecting feedback from other pieces of software is difficult, leaving important thoughts on the studio floor. Notion busts the silos between teams while organizing relevant feedback from everyone in one place, making it actionable.
Watch this👇 4-minute video for everything on comments and discussions.
----
Iterations give decisions full context— you can see what went into every design decision because drafts and commentary for that project are organized in one place. If you want to resurface a version of that mobile dropdown menu, or understand why the brand color changed from purple to periwinkle, you have a full field of vision from start to end of every single project.
This project management system pulls double duty, keeping your projects organized while centralizing all the work related to every project. Time spent hunting for information is reallocated to your craft.
Set your designers off on the right foot by using templates — page formats that you can recreate inside your project management system with a single click.
----
Whether it's a project kickoff or retrospective, templates help your designers approach problems with the same set of criteria.Even broader, templates can help new designers get up to speed on your team's philosophy and provide important decision-making context for veterans and newbies alike.
On the right side of your board, click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton and select+ New template. A blank page will appear. Here's where you'll create the template once so you can use it over and over again (you can also edit it, as your design process morphs).
For designers specifically, here are a few ideas for templates:
----
Project kickoff— under an "Overview"H2header, you can haveH3headers for "Problem Statement" and "Proposed Work." Then, under anH2header for "Scope," you can haveH3headers for "Requirements," "Timeline" and "Future Work." One thing we like to do is include prompts under these headers in a different color. Under "Proposed Work," you can write a sentence that says, "High-level overview of what we're building and why we think it will solve the problem." Change its color by clicking the⋮⋮icon and selectingColorfrom the menu.
----
Design spec— when sharing a mockup with your design team, using a template can ensure edge cases are considered and appropriate feedback is gathered. In the template, you can use aSelectproperty to denote the type of work you're doing: "Spec." You can even include other properties, likeDatefor proposed launch date or aPersonto tag reviewers. In the body of the template, createH3headers that give your team a space to embed the design, leave feedback, and outline next steps.
----
Client presentation —if you're at an agency, you can share Notion pages with clients. This collates feedback into one place, instead of your designers digging through emails or Figma comments. IncludeH2headers that neatly organize your design work, necessary context, and give clients a place for feedback. You can even include aTextproperty titled "Summary" and give clients the one-sentence rundown of the project's status. Then, when you're ready to share it, selectSharefrom the top right of the page and toggleShare to the web. From the dropdown menu, toggleAllow comments, which will give your clients the ability to comment on your work. Then you're ready to hitCopy linkand send it off.

Sam Baldwin is new to Notion's design team and from day one, he's been contributing. He says, "Notion's project management system enabled me to quickly get up to speed with all the projects, priorities, and a sense of what everyone is working on. A shared tasks board promotes an open, transparent way of working. Anyone can weigh in on current projects or offer feedback, leading to better outcomes."
Here are a few tips we've learned from our own design project management system:
Linking project management systems between teams— if yourengineering teamis using Notion to organize their projects, you can link your two systems together so no one ever misses a beat.
----
Add aRelationproperty to templates or pages in your board. Then search for your engineering team's project management database. So, if you're redesigning your website's homepage, you can link all the engineering tasks associated with that project, like code reviews and UX updates.
You can use aRelationproperty to connectmeeting notestoo. No matter where other tasks or meeting notes are located in Notion, you can collect everything for a project in one place to help your team work more efficiently.
----
Pages where designers see only their tasks— many designers use individual pages to manage their own work. Inside these pages, you can link a specific view of your team-wide project management board. When a designer updates a task in their personal view, it's reflected in the team-wide project management board (and vice-versa).
Type/linkand selectCreate linked database. Search for your project management system and it'll appear right in that designer's page.
Then+ Add a view, using aFilterto surface only your tasks. This helps you focus while still working toward overall goals. You can also do this in yourdesign wiki, creating a view that shows only projects in motion this week.
----
Tags or views for projects that are open for feedback— since Notion fosters transparency and collaboration between teams, we've created a tag that lets teammates know we'd like their opinions.
In your project management board, create aSelectproperty called "Feedback," and make one of the tags "RFC" (request for comment).
When you're kicking off a project or just mocked up a spec, you can tag the page RFC and circulate it with the entire team on Slack. That way, you can crowdsource feedback to make designs even stronger.

Connect projects and docs to get more done, faster
If your team is using one tool to manage projects and another for documentation, productivity suffers. Team members frequently switch tools to search for relevant information, which interrupts their flow and reduces efficiency.
Instead of paying for several specific tools, why not consolidate all your work into a single place?
In Notion,project managementis connected to the docs, notes, wikis and knowledge that support your work, so you always understand who’s doing what - and why.
----
In this guide, we’ll show you how to use our Projects & tasks databases to manage your team’s workload and move projects forward. You’ll learn how automation and Notion AI can help you breeze through repetitive work.
To start managing your projects and tasks in Notion, head over to theTemplatesmenu in your sidebar, findProjects & tasks, and duplicate the template into your workspace.
You’ll now find the two databases available in your workspace. Here’s a quick overview of what you can do with them:
----
Look at your projects and tasks in different ways— Each database has different, helpful views, filtered and sorted to show sub-sets of information. For example, you can view only ongoing projects or see all projects on a timeline. There are also board layouts where you can update task or project status with a simple drag and drop.
Identify blockers preventing a project from moving forward— TheBlockingproperty in your projects database lets you mark a project that must be completed before another one can begin, so you can better prioritize your workload.
Split large tasks into sub-tasks— Use the sub-task and dependencies properties on your Tasks database to break tasks into manageable steps and get granular about what needs to be done.
----
Add tasks to corresponding projects—  Projects and tasks are connected via a relation property. This means as you add new tasks, you can connect them to their corresponding project.
Visualize how close projects are to completion— Display the project completion percentage as a progress bar or ring so you know how much work is left. This rollup property calculates how many related tasks are marked “Done.” Learn more about relations and rollupshere.
Plan your team’s sprints in Notion— If you select Projects, tasks & sprints from the template gallery, you’ll get a third database where you can plan your sprints and assign tasks to each new sprint. Learn more about sprint planninghere.
Import your projects and tasks
----
If you already track tasks in another tool (or collaborate with teams that use different tools), import your work into Notion to give everyone full transparency.

Import your entire project management system from Asana to Notion with our importer tool — learn morehere.
Notion databases are totally flexible, and you can customize the properties and layout of each database to adapt them to your team’s unique workflow.
To add a new property to the database, go to the…menu, clickProperties, then+ New property.
Here are some suggested properties for your projects and tasks databases.
----
Add a brief description of the project or task— Providing an overview of a project or task with theDescriptionproperty means everyone can understand what’s involved from just a glance at the database.
Tag collaborators separately from owners—  Use theCollaboratorsproperty to tag everyone else involved in a project, making clear who’s leading the initiative and who’s contributing to it.
Estimate the work involved in a task to distribute them evenly among your team— Some tasks are more demanding than others. With theEstimatesproperty, you can score tasks according to the amount of work involved. Use the t-shirt sizing (S -XL) method, points, or devise your own scoring system.

See how competing tasks intersect in timeline view— TheDependenciesproperty (only visible in timeline view) lets you visibly connect tasks that block other tasks.
As well as adding new properties, you can create several custom database views. For example, you could create filtered views to show all tasks assigned to you or projects you are collaborating on. You can also sort the Task database by due date, priority, project, or created date.
Projects are powered by databases

----
Notion’sRelationproperty lets you build a 2-way connection between one database and another. Projects and Tasks are already related, which is why you can assign tasks to a project and see project completion rate, according to how many tasks have been done.
Build more connections throughout your workspace by relating projects and tasks to other databases. This makes it easier to find relevant information and keep the context behind your work in easy reach.
To add a new database relation, selectRelationin the+ New propertymenu. Select the database you want to connect, and toggleShow on...if you want the relation property to appear on the other database.
----
For example, you could relate your projects database to your meeting notes to quickly resurface relevant meeting notes on a project page, without needing to search for them.
Or, create a relation with your docs database to access helpful documentation like feature specs, PRDs, or RFCs from your project page.
Everyone working on the project will quickly find supporting information, and understand why their work matters.
Often, the most repetitive tasks slow down teams and hamper progress.
Instead of manually adding new tasks to do, updating statuses, and writing project briefs from scratch, you can dramatically accelerate your work using automation.
----
Notion’s repeating templates and buttons can reduce manual tasks and simplify complex workflows for everyone.
You can create templates inside any database. Go to the dropdown next toNew, select+ Add new template, and customize the page with all the relevant information every time you recreate a particular kind of doc.
If you need to recreate a particular template regularly, you can turn your template into a repeating template. To do this, click the…menu next to the template, then chooseRepeat. You can then configure how often you want a new entry to appear in the database — daily, monthly, etc.
This is handy for recurring tasks like writing your weekly newsletter, daily social posts, or admin tasks.
----
Repeating templates can supercharge routine work

Create a button anywhere in your workspace to insert blocks to the page, add entries to a database, or edit pages in a database. Buttons can do several actions at once, meaning you can condense a complex process down to a single click.
To add a button, open the/menu and selectButton. Next, configure the button and add all the steps you require.
You could use buttons to:
Submit an urgent design request in one click— Configure your button to add an entry to your design team’s request database, and add a second step to set the “Priority” property on the new page to “Urgent.”
----
Simplify the bug-reporting process— You can make it easier for your team to report bugs by adding a button where anyone can submit a bug to your engineering team’s bug-tracking database. Automatically complete properties — setDate reportedto today’s date andReported byto whoever clicks the button.
Perform triage on your overdue tasks— Create a button that assigns all overdue tasks to the person who clicks the button. This can help you catch up on overdue work and lets everyone know who’s responsible for completing those tasks.

Notion has a built-in AI assistant to help with whatever you need, without breaking your flow by switching to another tab.
----
Use Notion AI to generate all kinds of text, and even automatically complete database properties to cut down repetitive work.
With Notion AI, you can write and edit text, expand your thinking through brainstorming, create an action plan to achieve any goal, and much more.
You’ll be able to automate tedious, repetitive tasks, and create documentation in a fraction of the time, freeing up your team free to focus on important work.
To open the Notion AI menu, hit the spacebar on a new line. From there, you can choose from options like writing with AI, generating content from information on the page, brainstorming ideas, outlining a doc, and more. You can also just start typing a custom prompt.
----
Here are just a few ways you could use Notion AI to glide through project management:
Complete project briefs in minutes— Notion AI can outline a project and complete the brief with a few follow-up prompts. You’ll be able to draft an entire project brief from scratch in a fraction of the time it usually takes.
Get an overview of a doc with an AI-generated summary— By adding an AI-generated summary to documents, you can help team members get up to speed without reading an entire page from start to finish. You can add a Summary block to the top of any page or just ask Notion AI to summarize the content.
----
Extract action items from any page— After a project kickoff meeting, you can ask Notion AI to review the meeting notes and surface action items. You’ll instantly catch any tasks to be done and get them into your tasks database so nothing gets missed.
Draw up a roadmap for completing a project—  You knowwhatyou want to achieve but nothowto get there. Why not ask Notion AI to help you plan your project roadmap? You can brainstorm all the steps needed to complete your project successfully.
Discover Notion AI

----
Add an AI autofill property to your projects and tasks databases to automatically fill out text properties on new database entries. This will further reduce repetitive work and ensure you don’t end up with database entries that only contain partial information.
Go to New property in the database properties menu and select🪄Fill with AI.
Now you can choose from the following options how you want Notion AI to complete the property:
Automatically summarize the database entry— If you selectSummary, Notion AI will automatically produce a summary of the page content and display it as a property. This summary updates as the page content changes, giving everyone a real-time overview of how a project is progressing.
----
Surface key info in the database view— Extract insights using theExtract key infoAI prompt which will highlight actions to do or the main takeaways from the database page.
Design a custom prompt for your property— You can also build a custom prompt telling Notion AI exactly what you want to display. Try asking AI to generate a user story for a task, list potential risks that might block progress on a task, or summarize the key results, goals, or metrics associated with a project.

While the information presented in this guide is still useful, some elements of the sidebar have been updated — making sharing with the right groups easier. Learn about howteamspaces give every team a home for their important work.
Notion's customizable permission levels offer different levels of access to different people in a workspace.
Admins have the highest level of access, including the ability to add and remove members, change workspace settings, and update billing information. They are responsible for inviting new members or guests to the workspace.
Members can access all pages shared with the team.
----
Guests, usually external collaborators, can only access specific pages shared with them.
Notion also allows for the creation of permission groups for more granular control over page permissions.
Additionally, Notion offers the feature to share a read-only page publicly, to give visibility to those who do not have a Notion account.

Assign custom database permissions to make your life easier
Notion databases give you and your teammates a customizable place totrack engineering sprints,build company OKRs,manage content calendars, and more. As your team grows, the structure and properties of each database will become integral to your day-to-day operations, and any accidental edits or deletions can be quite disruptive. To prevent them, we suggest using the “Can edit content” permissions role to manage who can perform which actions in a database.
New to using Notion databases?
Click to expand
----
The new “Can edit content” permission level prevents accidental edits to the database’s structure — views, filters, property names, property types & more — while still allowing your colleagues to edit the content inside the database pages.
Within a database,content editors can edit individual entries to a database, including:
creating and deleting database entries (pages)
using existing database templates
editing database properties in a given row
Unlike full access users however,content editors can’t control database structure, including:
changing a database name, description, or icon
adding or removing a property, or changing a property's type
creating or changing views, including modifying sorts, filters, or groups
----
To get started using this feature, open theSharemenu of a database and use the dropdown menu to change permission settings for people, groups, or even everyone at your company at once.
Giving teammates specialized permissions gives you peace of mind that your colleagues have just the right level of access — not too restrictive but not too permissive. Generally speaking, we recommend assigning some top-level database administrators with full access, and making it known to your team who these people are. For anyone else, a “Can edit content” role should suffice.
----
For example, consider restricting full access from all writers in a larger editorial calendar. Whether these are content developers, executives, or guest posters, permissions empower writers to follow the content management system you’ve put in place, without the unnecessary concern of modifying it for their peers. Even if these writers aren’t familiar with Notion, their mission is clear: add a publish date, indicate the status of the piece, and get to what they love — writing.
View more sharing and permission settings
Click to expand
----
Users with “Can edit content” permissions can’t add new select or multi-select property values, which can be helpful when tagging and grouping a larger dataset. For example, in a tasks database, you might want to use a status property to indicate the progress of a task. If all users have full access, it’s easy for someone to accidentally create a new status (whether by typo or misunderstanding) which can have cascading downstream effects for a project timeline.
----
When you customize the permissions for your team, you won’t need to be worried about this risk — and won’t be left spending an hour trying to figure out who knows the difference between “pending”, “in progress,” and “in development.” Data administrators can take it a step further, by adding synced blocks to database templates, explaining what each property means — perfect for big, ongoing projects and tracking where data definitions are really important.
While users with “Can edit content” permissions can’t change or create database views on the main instance of a database, theycancreate views on linked databases in other pages. To add a linked database view, simply type/linkedand select your data source.
----
In the example of a single, shared “tasks” database, a user might want a view where they can see only their tasks assigned within the past week. To create this, just add a linked database block, select the tasks database source, and create a filter like normal. This will not add a view to the main database that everyone shares, but will provide the level of customizability your teammates might want. And of course, if everyone on the team wanted a custom view like this, there’s always the@meoption to filter dynamically based on which user is viewing the content.
Go further on sharing and permissions
Permission groups are the worry-free way to give or restrict access to Notion pages — learn more inthis guide.

Automate work with repeating database templates
Our personal and professional lives are made up of habits, tasks and events that happen daily, weekly or monthly. With Notion’s repeating database templates, you can create a page template once and set it to create new entries in the database as often as you need.
This guide will show you to use repeating database templates to create recurring tasks, meetings and docs in your workspace.
Database templatesspeed up your work and help you standardize your processes. You can quickly recreate a type of document, meeting agenda, task or project based on a template you’ve already created.
Learn more about database templates
Click to expand
----
Database templates allow you to pre-populate pages in a database, like your weekly sync meeting notes. Every heading, prompt, and bullet point is outlined and ready to go. You can even tag the folks who always attend, and label it with the right category.
Without repeating templates, someone still needs to remember to create that entry every time, and with so much work on your plate, anything that saves energy (and cut down on clicks) is a bonus.
Now imagine a task one of your team members has to do every Monday morning. Do you create a new entry into your team’s “Tasks” database every week? Or, once they’ve completed the task, do they move it back into the “To Do” column and change the due date?
----
Both of these approaches work, but can be slightly cumbersome, and there’s a risk of tasks getting forgotten.
With repeating database templates, you now only have to create a template for a task, meeting or document once. Then, you can set it up to repeat as often as you need, and the item will automatically be created in the database. All that’s left to do is fill it out or check it off.
To create a repeating template in a database, first create a database template as your normally would - go to the dropdown next to “New”, select “+ New template”, and start editing your page.
----
Then, click “...” next to your new template in the dropdown menu. Select “Repeat”, and choose how often you want an entry to be created from the template. You can choose every day, week, month or year, or go to “Custom”. Here, you can customize the repeating frequency further, and choose whether you want your repeating template to appear every 3 days, on Tuesday and Thursday every week, or every 2 months, for example.
----
Once you’ve selected your frequency a new item will appear in the database, based on your template, when the time comes. You can turn any of your existing templates into repeating templates by following the same process. If you ever want to stop a repeating template, you can either delete the template entirely, or go to the template options and turn “Repeat” off.
Repeating database templates can speed up and standardize your work, so you can spend more time on your most important jobs, and less time on tedious administrative tasks.
You can use them in many different ways to automate a lot of your project management work.
Here are some of the different ways you might use repeating database templates in your workspace:
----
Set a recurring template in your task database once, and you can trust it will always appear in your “To-do” list when the time comes.
You can create recurring tasks to fill out your monthly report and the end of every month, clear your desk every Friday afternoon, or even spend 30 minutes a day answering emails.
You don’t have to worry about constantly recreating those repetitive tickets. Instead, you can just focus on getting them done.
You might find yourself creating documents summarizing the status of all your current projects, or provide general team updates, every week. You always do this at the same time every week and use the same format to draft the doc.
----
This is a perfect opportunity to use a repeating template. Create a repeating template for your document with headers, bullets and text blocks ready so all you have to do is fill in key information. If you already have an existing template, just go to options, select “Repeat” and choose your frequency.
What about the Created By property?
A repeating template will show as being “Created By” Notion automation — be sure to adjust views and filters accordingly when you start using these in your workspace!
Another handy use for repeating templates is for meeting notes. You know that every Monday morning you have your weekly team standup, and every other Thursday is the company’s all-hands.
----
To save the trouble of creating a new page every time, you can create repeating database templates in your meeting notes database and schedule them for when those meetings occur.
For monthly all-hands, weekly syncs and daily standups, you can automatically create a meeting agenda that’s ready for teammates to add to. They’ll get notified when they’re tagged in it, and you can even create a view of meetings and link it in your recurring calendar invite.
You can use repeating database templates in any database, wherever you want to automatically generate items based on a template.
----
For example, your company wiki or knowledge base has a database for quarterly goals, you could create a template for planning and documenting your OKRs. You can then set this up to recreate every 3 months, so it’s ready to fill in after the quarterly management meeting.
Or, if you have a database for weekly announcements that everyone can read and contribute to,  a repeating template could be useful.
Even the finance team might use repeating templates when it’s time to create their monthly invoices.

Automatically generate blocks, pages and more with the click of a button
Maybe you spend a lot of time creating and editing pages in Notion, adding text, lists, database entries, editing their properties and more. Maybe you even build frameworks and teach others how to use them.
Now, imagine if you could automate and simplify those repetitive tasks and do multiple things at once - literally with the click of a button?
Instead of painstakingly configuring third party automation tools, you can place buttons anywhere in your workspace to generate content, create pages, edit database entries and show confirmation dialogs.
----
Using buttons for request systems and complicated processes can streamline the workflow and save time for everyone - whether they’re new to Notion or a seasoned power user.
In this guide, we’ll explain how to create and configure buttons, and examples of ways you can use them.
To create a button, open the/menu and selectButton. This will open a configuration window where you’ll be prompted to choose what you want your button to do.
If you want to insert blocks into the page, chooseInsert blocksand then start adding content in the box by hitting the/command and choose from text, lists, images, embeds, databases, and more.
----
Once you’ve added your blocks, clickDone, and your button will appear on the page. Click it to reproduce those blocks whenever you need them.
Convenient, right? But there aremany morethings your button can do—including a combination of several actions.
If you want to change the button action or add more steps, go to the⚙️ Configureicon next to the button, and either...next to your current action, or+ Add another stepbelow.
Let’s take a more in-depth look at how each function works.
TheInsert blocksaction will add content into the same page where you create the button. You can add as many blocks as you want, from simple toggles to full page templates, and pre-fill information your team needs for a recurring task.
This could help you
----
Spin up a checklist for your team— Insert a “To-do list” where the items will always be the same, such as a checklist for marking a feature spec document as complete, or handing over a project.
Write a content brief in minutes— Configure your button to outline an article, so you can generate instructions, prompts, headers, notes, writing guidelines, and even placeholder images. Then, all you have to do is customize and assign it to a team member to complete.
Develop your team wiki and workspace— Put a “Create new page” button so you can quickly add new pages to expand your knowledge base. You can pre-populate the page's required parts so it’s easy to complete.
----
You can use buttons to create new database entries and edit the properties of existing ones. This can help you streamline processes for newer Notion users and embed action steps in a document.
Database templates vs buttons
Your database templates let you create new items in a database based on a pre-designed format. With buttons, you can add or edit page properties in a database from anywhere in the workspace. Try using a button to create a page, and then a database template to populate the page's content.
Let’s say you want to create an “Add new task” button in your department home, so you can quickly add action items to the team’s task database without leaving the page.
----
First, create a button and selectCreate page in a databasein the editor. Next toCreate page in, choose the database you want to add to - in this case, Tasks.
Next, go to theEdit a propertydropdown where you can choose one or more properties to automatically fill out. Since this is a new task, you could automatically set the “Status” property to “To do” or “Not started”. You may also want to assign the task to someone by default, or set an arbitrary due date, such as “One week from today”.
You can use this to create new pages in any database, from your meeting notes and docs to your projects or client database.
Here are some other ways to use this button:
----
Report a bug to engineering team— Your Go-to-Market team can flag bugs or issues for engineering to look without going to the bug tracker database.
Add new product requirement document— Your product team can instantly start a new PRD with a button. Create an outline prompting you to complete the who, what and why of the product, and automatically tag product team.
Submit a design request— If your content team needs a new graphic for a blog post, they can send a request straight to the design team’s project database.
Create a company update— Whenever your People team need to send a company-wide update, the can create one with a button.
----
A button can help you simultaneously update properties for all pages in a database, or all those that meet certain criteria.When you choose theEdit pages in databasefunction, select the database you want to edit.
Then, you can use a filter to choose the types of entries you want to edit, then you can choose the property you want to assign them.
For example, you could:
Make a button to assign all overdue tasks to you— Filter the database to show all tasks where the due date is on or before today. Then, choose the “Assign” property, and replace it with “Person who clicked the button”.  This could also be useful for an engineer taking over triage of recently reported bugs.
More about person properties
----
"Person" is a dynamic property. When you select “Person who clicked the button” instead of your own name from the drop down, whoever clicks will be tagged. So, when someone clicks “Assign tasks to me”, they will be tagged.
Let teammates mark a document as “complete”— For a knowledge base article that’s required reading, you can add a person property called “Complete”. Then, add a button at the end where people can tag themselves.
Change the status of tasks— Your button can edit the “Status” property of a task, so you can easily move a task, or group of tasks, from “Up next” to “In progress”.
----
When you add “Open page” as an action step, another page will open when you click the button. This could be the page you’ve created in a previous step, or another page of your choosing.
So for example, if you’ve created the “Add new task” button mentioned previously, you could go to+ Add another stepand choose “Open page”. Then you can selectPage createdto go straight to the new task you’ve just created.
An “Add new page” button could also have a second step to open the page that’s just been created, so you can immediately jump in to editing.
You can decide whether you want to open as a full page, side peek or center peek.
Your button can generate a pop-up box offering two possible choices - to either continue or abandon the workflow.
----
This can be helpful for reinforcing process with your team members, and to ensure they are creating content intentionally.
For example, a pop-up could appear when someone attempts to assign tasks to themselves, saying “Are you sure you want to assign all outstanding tasks to you?”
Add confirmation dialog to your button
Open the button editor ⚙️. Click + Add another step and choose Show confirmation dialog. You can then edit the text you want to appear.
Buttons are a powerful automation tool and there’s no limit to how you can use them.
They can help you create new content based on templates, or edit all similar database entries with a click.
By making your team’s processes more efficient, you can scale your workflow and systems with ease.
----
Want more inspiration for how to use buttons in your workspace? Here are some more ideas:
Create a meeting agenda and notes— If you have a shared page for 1:1s with a team member, you can create a “New meeting” button inside that page. Place questions, prompts and bullet points that you use for the meeting in the “Insert blocks” module. When it’s time for the meeting just click the button and you’re ready to take notes.
----
Mark a document as finished— Use the Edit database properties action to mark the status of a document in your docs database as complete. You might add this button inside the document itself, to make it easy for your team members to update several properties at once - mark status as “Done” and fill out completed date as “Today.” You can even add another step to the button, which will create a new item in your tasks database for a manager to review the document.
----
Request multiple items with one button— You can make a button to request multiple actions once a project is launched. For example, by clicking the “Launch” button, you could add a post to the social media calendar, send a content request to the content calendar and change the project status to “In Progress”.

Best practices for internal communications on Notion
Internal communication is extremely important for keeping high-performing teams aligned. As your team grows, it demands more structure, more thoughtful updates, and the intentional collection of cross-functional information. When it comes to internal communication, Notion can help you stay organized and make sure every team member is up to date on important company topics.
In this Guide we'll walk through some best practices for internal communications in Notion, and share some pro tips from the Notion Executive Operations team.
----
If teams don’t have structure to their information, it may live in many places, making it hard for team members to stay up to date on company happenings — sometimes resulting in confusion or mistakes. Notion brings all your information together in one place, so you can save time searching for this information.
We sat down with Cuyler Hirata, executive operations at Notion, to ask him how he thinks about internal communication on Notion. Reflecting on common pitfalls he’s seen, he noted the following:
----
When the team is smaller it's pretty easy to know where everything is at all times, but as the org grows and more people are added and more docs and pages are created, I think that's when information can get lost. Setting up your structure early on will go a long way.
Here’s some tips for ensuring people know where to access information.
Be consistent— as your company grows, you might have more people making announcements. In your docs database, you can create templates for each type of announcement you make. For example, your “Company-wide announcement” template might have sections for “Context” and “Next steps” to ensure all the edge cases are considered. And each type of template can be customized to the needs of the communication.
----
Use shared databases for all types of communication— make top-level pages in your sidebar for meeting notes and docs, ensuring everyone on your team knows where to go for updates. You can useSelectproperties to help designate the types of meetings (like “Sales” or “All-hands”) or the announcements that live in your docs database (like “Process change”).
Keep foundational pages in your company wiki— while each team has their own wiki, your company can have a top-level page that organizes things like your mission, values, and more. At Notion,we use a company-wide operating system(OS) for these types of pages. This helps teammates new and old stay up-to-date on the company’s most important philosophies.
----
Create a playbook— all new Notion employees receive our communications playbook, which outlines all our best practices. Whether it’s communication styles or expected response times, you can lay this information out for all employees so you establish a standard org-wide.
As you grow your team or company, these systems will simplify project management, marketing, onboarding, and everything in between.
The average attention span of an American adult is somewhere between 7 and 12 seconds, that means that a reader needs to be engaged immediately with an image, callout, or top-level heading. Using these on-page tools, you can structure information for your readers depending on the situation at hand.
----
Toggles— toggles help get the main points across to everyone, and the details to those who need it. Toggles are great for adding additional methodology behind data points, or listing details in a multi-step plan. Simply type>to create the toggle, and drag information inside of it.
Columns— grab the⋮⋮to drag-and-drop any block in your page and move it to the right to create columns (the blue lines will help guide you). This creates a column, where you can put images alongside text for easy viewing.
Callouts— callouts can help bring attention to the most important portions of your document. Internally we often use these to describe what a section is all about and add structure to our documents.
----
Visuals— images, videos, and embeds are the first thing a reader notices on a page. Type/to see what you can include. Use these to highlight key points, metrics, or spotlight an important announcement or feature.
Dividers— type-three times in a row to create a divider under headers. This brings a nice visual break to your pages to separate information.
Colors— whether it’s the color of the text or the background behind it, bring a pop of color to certain sections of your pages that you really want to call attention to. Highlight a block or text and use the⋮⋮to navigate toColor.
Typeform embeds— need to survey a group or receive feedback? Use the/Typeformblock or paste a link to the survey to embed surveys right inside of Notion.
----
The visual elements on the page come together to help you communicate information effectively. Because these pages are totally customizable, you can adjust them to the needs of that communication. Sometimes, it’ll be a quick update with a chart. Others will require more text and exposition. It’s up to you!
So you’ve organized your Notion and you’re feeling great about availability of information — now what? Get information in front of your teams through intentional distribution efforts.
----
Because Notion is so open and there's just so much available for folks to access there needs to be a bit of guidance and direction. That's why we brought about the bi-weekly newsletter. They're able to go in and really understand all of the key happenings from the past couple of weeks.
In addition to just meeting notes and announcements, you can also create company-wide updates using Notion (like Blinkist’s newsletter). This helps collect everything your teammates need to know in one place.
Some inspiration for this type of communication includes:
----
A monthly newsletter— take time to highlight key information in and around your team. This is great for onboarding new employees too. You can even create a Gallery database and include images of your new hires to introduce them to the broader team.
A weekly update you can share wherever— if you’re working on a project or need to update the team on the status of a process change, hit theCopy linkbutton in theSharemenu and send it out via Slack, email, or your team's platform of choice.
----
Make a page public so external folks can stay up to date— from investors to company friends, you can make a page public by toggling on that option in theSharemenu. This is helpful when you’re working with partners outside your org who need to be aware of company happenings.
Link to Slack Channel— you can connect every Notion update into a Slack channel using the Connect a Slack Channel feature.
Need an ultra-simple format for updates?

----
The simpler your communications are, the easier it will be for readers to find and know where to expect information, and the easier it will be to manage. For this, we recommend finding, creating and consistently using templates. There's a few types of templates in Notion, each with different use cases:
Database Templates— these are super powerful tools for robust communication systems. In the Notion "meeting notes" database, you'll find pre-created note structures for engineering syncs, user research, roadmapping, and more.Read about database templates here.
----
Notion Template Gallery— you can use this to find full page templates for your specific use case. Whether it's a team wiki, a company bulletin, or a personal vacation packing list, Notion's Template Gallery is a great place to start.
The template button— this is great for adding small updates to an ongoing list. For example, a weekly to do list, broken down by role, that doesn't require a new page each week.
Synced Blocks— you might have information that exists many places, like your company's mission statement. Before, whenever it was updated, you'd have to find all the places the mission was referenced and edit each individually. But now, with Synced Blocks, whenever you update the company mission, it's updated everywhere.

Block basics: build the foundation for your team’s pages
You and your team may have seen Notion pages and wondered, “How can we build something like that?”
Everything in a Notion page is a block. And after you get the hang of using blocks, building and customizing pages gets easier because you have a whole new set of options at your fingertips. Once you've made blocks, organizing them on a page is as simple as dragging and dropping —no coding requiredto make custom workflows.
Whether it’s a roadmap for your engineering team or resources shared by your entire company, you’ll be using blocks.
Text, images, audio, PDFs — they’re all blocks you can insert into pages.
----
Type/to quickly add content to any page (we call this the slash command). Let’s say you want to create a to-do list of tasks your team needs to complete before a big launch. In the body of any Notion page type/todoand you’ll get a checkbox. For a detailed list of block types, check out ourreference material.
Hit/and you’ll see clusters of block options you can scroll through and select. These include:
Basic blocks— lay the groundwork for your page. With basic blocks, you can add text, headings, bullets, numbered lists, and other bits to help your content flow.
----
In-line blocks— mention teammates, set dates or reminders, or reference other pages in your workspace. In-line blocks are great for collecting information, setting context, assigning deadlines, and keeping projects on track.
Media— whether it’s images, video, code, audio, or more, media blocks bring together teams who might be using different tools to do their work. You can have a design mockup right next to the code that brings it to life on your website.
Embeds— tie valuable resources into your pages by embedding a Typeform, PDF, and more. For example, if you’re creating a Contact Us page for your website, you can embed a Google Map of your company’s address.
----
Database— these aretables, boards, lists, and more. Database can be their own page, but they can also be in-line, meaning they're part of a page with other elements. Let’s say you want to create a home page for your sales team with all the resources they need. If you have a database containing your open sales deals, you can create aTable - Inlinedatabase so those deals display on your team’s home page, right next to resources like sales playbooks and messaging.
----
Advanced blocks— include a table of contents, math equations, and other pre-formatted elements to your pages. For example, if you do weekly one-on-ones with your team, you can add aTemplate Buttonto a page. Once you create your template, all you have to do is add information specific to your latest check-in.
If you don’t want to start from scratch, duplicate a copy of ourremote one-on-one templateto your workspace.
Blocks make Notion completely customizable so your team can work exactly how they want. All the different types of blocks come together on any Notion page, spurring cross-functional collaboration for teams.
----
After you’ve added blocks, you can also customize them to make your pages unique. Hover your cursor to the left of any block until the⋮⋮icon appears. Then you can:
Move existing blocks— rearrange and organize blocks on your pages based on your team’s needs, like thepages in your wiki. Drag on the⋮⋮icon and drop wherever you’d like.
Convert blocks— change blocks containing text into a bulleted list, callout, and other simple blocks. Let’s say you’re creating a case study and want to emphasize a quote from your customer. From the⋮⋮icon to the left of any block, selectTurn Into. Within the dropdown list, chooseQuoteto create a more stylized section for your key quote.
----
Color text and backgrounds— emphasize parts of your content by adding color to text or a block’s background. To do either on an existing block, click the⋮⋮icon to the left of the block. Then chooseColorand pick away. For example, if you're building out customer support pages and want to highlight a specific frequently asked question, change up the background color of that block.
If you want a specific letter or word in a block to be a different color, highlight it. Then selectAfrom the pop-up menu and choose from the color options.
Learn about otherstyles and customizationyou can add to pages.
If you’re interested in usingNotion for your team,you can use a plus plan trial, where you get free blocks to try it out.
----
Once you reach your block storage limit, you can still read, edit, and organize existing content, but won't be able to add new blocks.
If you or your team needs more than 1,000, upgrade your plan to get unlimited blocks. A fullPlus planalso includes:

Board view databases
Boards in Notion are an effective tool for project management. They provide a visual and organized way to manage tasks, projects, or processes.
Items can be organized into columns to visualize stages of a process or assignments.
Each entry in a board appears as a card in a column, with an option to show a preview of the entry's content.
Cards can be grouped by various properties and can be manually rearranged.
Boards can be seamlessly incorporated into your workspace.
They can be added to a workspace through the 'New page' button or by typing '/Board' within a page.
Boards can be created from scratch or using Notion's templates.

Build a docs-first culture with a beautiful team wiki, powered by a database
Clear, accurate documentation is the backbone of successful teams. When reliable information is readily available, team members can get on with their work instead of searching for information.
You need a documentation process where everyone can find the information they need, when they need it. And, when your teammates open a document they need to be sure of its accuracy.
But with hundreds of documents circling around, it can be difficult to keep everything current and trustworthy. Folks waste time asking whether this project scope includes everything discussed on the last client call, or if the brand guidelines and onboarding processes are still up to date.
----
To make matters worse, it’s not clearwhothey should ask. So, team members ping the wrong person or just drop their questions into a Slack group.
In this guide, we’ll show you why Notion is the perfect place to build a powerful team wiki which will be the single source of truth for relevant information.
A wiki is a great way to organize company or team information. With everything laid out in pages and columns, it’s simple to navigate and aesthetically pleasing.You can quickly draw up a wiki using templates like theProduct wiki,Engineering wikiand more from theTemplate gallery. Or create a team wiki from scratch by adding a top level page in your teamspace and then nestling relevant sub-pages inside.
Create your team wiki with templates
----
We’ve created wiki templates for yourproduct team,engineering team, and more which you’ll find in the template gallery. You can duplicate these and customize them for your team.
A team wiki will include things like your standard operating procedures (onboarding, project planning, etc), guides and training materials, key information about benefits and vacation policy, brand guidelines and more, all on a self-serve basis.
Write team docs faster with Notion AI
If you need assistance when building your knowledge library, call up Notion AI to help you write, summarize, outline, improve your writing and more. Learn all about Notion AIhere.
To level-up your wiki, click on the Options…drop down on the top right of the page and chooseTurn into Wiki.
----
When you do this, you’ll keep your beautiful wiki layout, and also unlock valuable features like the ability to categorize and organize pages, add properties, verify documents, create different views and layouts, and more.
Discover the possibilities of Notion databases
Databases let you organize, categorize, filter, search and view information in many different ways.Explore the database section of theHelp Centerand visitNotion Academyto learn how to use databases.
The wiki comes with 4 default properties: Owner (person property), Last edited date, Tags (multi-select) and a Verification property which is unique to wikis. You can add any additional properties to your team wiki that your team will find useful, such as Created date or Status.
----
With the verification property, you can mark documents in the wiki with an expiration date. Once the verification expiry date arrives, you’ll receive a notification that it’s time to review the document. Then, you can make any changes or updates needed and renew the document’s verification. Alternatively, you can mark a document as infinitely verified so that it will never expire - you can always adjust this later if necessary.
When your team members view a document and see the “Verified” property filled out, this will inspire trust. Only the page owner of a specific page in the wiki can verify it. When team members see the verification stamp, they’ll know the content has been checked and won’t need to ask around to make sure.
----
Verification properties will be automatically added to your wiki. Team members can then choose the date that they want their document to be verified until, or select “infinite”.
Here are some different ways the verification property comes in handy:
Signal that documents are complete and up to date— When team members see the “Verified” property, they’ll be able to trust that the document they’re looking at has been checked and marked as true and complete until further notice.
----
Get reminded when it’s time to review or update wiki content— Often, you don’t realize a document is out of date until someone comes across it and questions it. The verification property helps you stay on top of information and you know you’ll be reminded when the time comes to update your information.
Track and renew your team goals periodically— You can create a page in your wiki for quarterly goals and verify that page until the end of the current quarter. When it’s time to review the document, you’ll analyze your progress and set new goals for the upcoming quarter.
----
Create evergreen documents which won’t change— Documents like your company values and mission statement are likely to stay the same for a significant amount of time. You can mark these as infinitely verified so you never get notified to change them, though you can always change this status if necessary.
The verification property is unique to wikis
A wiki has all the same properties as a regular database, plus an additional verification property.Learn more about database propertieshere.
When you’re reviewing wiki content, you might want to see a particular sub-set of information - for example, everything related to onboarding, or training materials.
----
You can filter the information based on certain properties, sort information in unique ways, and create multiple views using different layouts.
Here are some ways you might filter, sort and organize your wiki content:
Review verified docs that are soon to expire— Sort your wiki by verification expiry date so you can start going through docs that will soon be up for review.
Check all non-verified docs in a simple list view— Create a filtered view of all docs where the verification property is either expired, or left blank. You can then go through these docs and start filling up necessary information.
----
Update everything related to a particular topic— If your company has just announced a change to the brand guidelines, for example, you can filter your wiki for everything tagged as related to branding. Then, go through and update all those docs with the changes.
Check the relevancy of your oldest wiki content for updates— You can sort your database by Created date (ascending) or Last edited date (ascending) and go through old or not frequently edited documents and see what needs to be refreshed.
Use permission settings to prevent unwanted edits
----
You can adjust the permission settings of your wiki pages to ensure only certain people can make changes to content. Nominate team members who will be responsible for maintaining the wiki, and grant them full access. Everyone else can have “View only” access.Learn more about permissions and sharing settingshere.
There are many possible ways to use the wiki feature, and you can essentially turn any page with sub-pages into a database, allowing you to add properties to those pages.
In addition to your team wiki, you could:
Build a company-wide wiki— Your organization’s wiki can include information about benefits, vacations, org charts, company goals, etc.
----
Create a customer help center wiki—  You can create a public-facing help center where customers can find guides, tutorials, pricing pages and FAQs. This can reduce your support team’s workload and help users get more from your product or service. Learn about publishing pages to the web
here.
Design an engineering process wiki— In your engineering team’s wiki, produce engineering-specific process documents like your triage process, design system, etc. The verification property will encourage your team to be more proactive about keeping all these process up-to-date.
Turn your client portal into a wiki— If you give clients access to a portal in Notion, you can make this into a wiki where it’s easier to filter and sort different information.

Build a website with Notion in seconds, no coding required
Adding a page to your company’s website is probably a lengthy process that requires balancing designers, engineers, and their busy schedules. Even the simplest pages are an effort in cross-functional work.
But in Notion, all it takes to publish a page to the web is a single click. You can:
Build beautiful pages without needing a developer— dozens of embeds and tools like headers and columns allow you to make a visually rich website without all the developer resources you often need for more complicated content management systems.
----
Publish pages yourself— don’t worry about wrangling designers or engineers to build or extend your site. You can quickly and easily make any Notion page public, accessible by a link you share, or even findable via search engines.
With Notion, you can stand up a website with just a few clicks. All you have to do is clickShareon any page, navigate to thePublishtab, and click onPublish to Web. Anyone with the link will be able to see it. And when you make edits, your page will change for visitors in real time. It's that simple!
If you don't want to start from scratch, here are a few templates you can use as a springboard to get your pages up faster. We’ve also included some inspiration from a few companies using Notion to build their websites.
----
Job Board— with the fluidity of hiring, it’s helpful to have access to a job board you’re able to quickly update, whether that’s removing filled roles, adding new ones, or rewriting your company mission. Make your pages eye-catching and informative, providing a window into what it’s really like working for your company.
Copy thejob board templateinto your own workspace.
Help Center— reduce your customer service email queue. Find the most commonly-asked questions by digging into your support inbox and publishing content covering those questions. This makes it easier for your customers to find the answers they’re looking for.
Notion makes it easy to organize this content as sub-pages, and edit it as needed.
----
Help yourself to thehelp center template.
Blog post— build a community and share dynamic content without relying on a rigid CMS. You can write blog posts in Notion and set them live, for a clean and easy reading experience. Embed elements like a table of contents, audio files, images and videos right into pages to create a more engaging experience.
Use theblog post templateto tell your story.
Roadmap— share your product roadmap with potential leads and existing customers. A published roadmap gives customers insight into when a feature will ship and you can even allow them to submit feature requests by turning on public editing.
Duplicate theroadmap templateinto your own workspace.
----
Type/onto any page to reveal a whole menu of elements you can include on these pages. To access them, type/and the name of what you want to do, like/imageor/typeform.
Headers & line breaks— make your content easier to scan and navigate withH1,H2, andH3headers. Separate long walls of text with line breaks by typing three dashes in a row.
Columns— give a page that clean newspaper-style layout with an image on one side and text on the other. Using the⋮⋮icon, you can drag-and-drop any pages, text, images, etc. anywhere on Notion pages. If you want to make columns, drag anything to the left or right of existing content. Blue vertical lines will appear to help guide you.
----
Table of contents— this gives readers the ability to jump to whichever section they need on your site. Type/tocto create a table of contents that uses your headers to break down sections.
Image / video / audio— create a multimedia experience. You can embed YouTube videos, upload podcast files, or drag images right into your Notion page. Using the bars on the sides of images or video, you can even adjust their size.
Typeform embed— gather feedback or create a contact portal by inserting a Typeform into your Notion page.
Callouts & quotes— bring attention to a specific section or sentence with callouts or quotes, much like you’d find in many popular blogs.
----
Toggles lists— for content like FAQs, you can make your website even easier to navigate by helping site visitors see only the most relevant information to them. Put top-level info into a toggle’s preview, and nest more info inside it.
Colors— customize your design or emphasize content with different text or background colors. Highlight any text and select•••, then chooseColorto pick either the text or background color.
Search engine indexing— drive traffic and make your page visible on Google and other search engines.
Link expiration— if you want to share your site only temporarily, use link expiration options. Great for sharing a custom portfolio with a client, or a sensitive doc with an external partner.
----
Visual customization— in the "Sites customization" menu you can change how your site appears to the world. Customize the link preview, change the heading, and even select a theme option (black, or white).
Integrate with Google analytics— quickly and easily understand your site performance by integrating with google analytics (in the "Sites customization" menu).
Allow duplicate as template— let’s say you’ve built a great landing page template and you think other companies would benefit from this format. Make your page duplicatable as a template that they can save in their ownNotion workspace.Find this option in the "Sites customization" menu, under the header options.

Building a product requirement document in Notion
As a product manager, you're often working to pitch your product vision to many teams all at once. This requires intentional communication and carefully curated documents that fit the needs of the teams you're partnering with. A product requirement document (PRD) written in Notion can help to streamline and improve that communication.
----
A product requirement document outlines all of the steps you'll need to take to build a product — and it can vary a lot in structure from company to company, and even project to project. After initial ideation, a PRD will lay out all of the context for a project and can be used get multiple stakeholders on the same page. The overarching goal of a PRD is to tell the story of how your users will be using a product, without getting too far into the technical details. Often, product teams use PRDs to get alignment from multiple teams, and to serve as the single source of truth for a project.
Interested in user research?
Click to expand
----
Ask 5 different people, and you'll get 5 different answers on what a PRD should include. Using Notion for your PRD means that you can contextualize the document to fit your use case. Need a lot of images? No problem. Need more wireframes? Easy. Typically, all PRDs will share the same 5 attributes.
Context
Goals or Requirements
Constraints
Assumptions
Dependencies
PRDs are typically a one page document that links out to any number of other sources, like design documents, images, user interviews, and more. Depending on how your team uses Notion, consider adding a PRD to a larger database of all projects, or creating a page in yourproduct home workspace.
A good PRD will tell the reader everything they need to know about a project.
----
You may choose to include summary text with context, a Loom walkthrough of a previous iteration of a product, or an audio recording of a user feedback call. Different projects require context delivered in different ways, and it’s important the reader has all the information so they’re not operating with blind spots down the line. Some tried and true strategies include:
Add text and columns— to add text, just start typing. To explore other block types use the / command. In addition, columns in Notion can be used to put information side by side. Using the⋮⋮icon, simply drag and drop information next to the relevant block. This is great for adding images with extra detail, or comparing new and old versions of a product.
----
Embed everything, right in one place— did you know you can add Figma, Sketch, GitHub, full webpages, andpretty much anything else, right inside Notion? This makes it easy to communicate your process and vision for a product in a customizable yet consolidated format. Your team can focus on the work at hand, instead of jumping between tools to find what they need.
----
Synced blocks allow you to pull information from any place in Notion and keep all the documents up to date. In doing so, information stays consistent across pages. For example, you might have a mission statement you want at the top of your PRD. Turn that into a Synced Block, selectCopy and syncthen paste that block right into your PRD. That way, when the mission gets updated, it'll be updated everywhere automatically.
Use a database for task management if needed. While you may not need task management in the first iteration of your PRD, a database with responsibilities can be helpful as you grow and scale your project.
Assign tasks to individuals or groups with thePersonproperty.
----
Add aDateproperty for due date and use a formula to calculate days until due.
Add a priority column withSingle select.
Want to go further with task management?

Views will start to make your database feel super powerful. Rather than creating a Google calendar for your team, or a separate to-do tracker for each person, utilize views and filters to make sure everyone has exactly what they need to do their best work. The best part of this is that each view relies on the same underlying data and is therefore always up to date.
Board View— best for task management, because cards are grouped by priority or assignee and easily dragged between stages.
----
Table View— birds eye view to manage all tasks and properties across functions and teams.
List View— view just the task list for a sleek and minimal vibe, or isolate properties to visually represent work.
Gallery View— focus on images or page contents for a more graphical view.
Calendar View— see cards as tasks on a calendar for big picture road mapping.
Interested in learning more about views?
Click to expand
Since a PRD will generally be shared with many folks working on or interested in a project, collaborative settings are important to keep everyone on the same page. For example:
----
Request inputs— using the @ key, tag stakeholders in comments so that you can get input right where you need it, and it will be visible to everyone else. Alternatively, you can add toggles at the bottom of a document where each person can add their own feedback.
Upvote ideas— ask teammates to add "+1s" in comments to dial in on the most important parts of your project, and elaborate with their feedback.
Control access— adjust permission settings in the share menu on the top right such that only those who need it have comment or editing power.

Calendar view databases
In Notion, calendars are databases that allow you to organize information by date.
Add an item to a calendar by clicking on the + sign next to date. This will create a new database page where you can collect all your research, interview recordings, or even full drafts of what you want to write.
Calendar databases must have at least one date property, but can have more. These can be used to organize entries by different dates. You can also add other properties such as text, numbers, single-select menus, multi-select menus, dates, people and more.
Notion allows you to choose a monthly or weekly calendar view for your database, and you can decide how your database pages open up when you click on them.
----
Remember that calendars are just one of multiple kinds of database views you can create with Notion. You can also view this same data in custom-built table views, lists, boards, and switch seamlessly between them by clicking on their tabs.

Use charts to visualize data and track progress directly in Notion
With Notion’s connected workspace, you can get your projects to the finish line faster and with less context switching. But without visualizations, managing large amounts of tasks can be cumbersome. Charts take your project management to the next level, helping you to monitor project progress, spot trends, and make decisions.
With Notion charts you can:
Visualize your project in realtime —Forget about separate tools or tedious copy-pasting. When you add charts from Notion databases, they’ll update automatically whenever a change is made to the underlying data or tasks.
----
Make more informed decisions —Looking at hundreds of tasks in a database can be overwhelming. Charts let you easily spot trends, monitor progress, and make decisions to move forward quicker than you might be able to otherwise.
Break free from complicated analytics tools —We all love our data partners, but we’d prefer not to need them for absolutely everything. With charts, anyone can make beautiful visualizations in a few clicks using the UI they already know (and, hopefully, love!)
In this guide, we’ll cover how to make a chart, and discuss ways that you can use them to improve your project management in Notion.
----
Charts work like any otherdatabase view— meaning you can view the same data in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. To create a view, simply navigate to the+button in your database and select “Chart.” Within your chart view, you can filter your data, and customize your chart to craft a perfect picture of your project’s progress.
Looking for charts docs?
Click to expand
Notion charts come with 4 layout options, each serving a unique purpose:
----
Donut charts for simple distribution— Donut charts are a simple option for visualizing the distribution of tasks across different categories or team members, providing a clear view of resource allocation. For example, you might use one to analyze and balance the task load across your engineering team in a given sprint.
Horizontal and vertical bar charts for multi-dimensional categorization— Bar charts let you view database items with sub-groups, helping you quickly compare two categories, like status and task type. You might use a one of these to understand OKR progress by team and identify a bottleneck in your operating model.
----
Line charts for progress over time —Line charts are best for tracking the progress of tasks over time, and can even be used to compare sub-groups. Like the number of pieces published each week in a given quarter, broken down by channel; or the number of tasks completed over time, by engineer.
As mentioned, you’ll also be able to sort and filter the data in your chart, add axis and data labels, and even customize your color palate. Learn more in the video below:
Now that you’ve got the basics, let’s dive in to how charts help your work in the real world.
----
Since charts are database views, you can create them anywhere in Notion by navigating to the page where you want the view to appear and typing/chart. Here you’ll be prompted to link an existing database. Do this multiple times, and you’ll be able to make a dashboard that lets you visualize data from multiple databases, or from the same database (in multiple ways!) in a single place.
The beauty of Notion’s connected workspace means that unlike a chart created based on static data in a spreadsheet, these dashboards are living records of the work going on across your team, and they update in realtime. Use them for one database, or many. You might want to:
----
Centralize scattered tracking systems —if you have teams working across different project trackers (like your engineering tasks, and marketing campaign calendar), consider creating a dashboard to visualize the status of both projects simultaneously.
Get an in-depth view of important work— similarly, you might want to create a dashboard to view different cuts of the same database. Like an OKR dashboard that highlights different project statuses, key result progression, and tasks completed over time.
----
Visualize team progress across projects— as a team manager, you could create a dashboard to understand individual performance, irrespective of project statuses. Here, you might look at tasks assigned to each of your reports, overall projects each team member is on, and more.
So how can you use charts (and dashboards!), to enhance your work? Let’s consider three different kinds of projects that we commonly see managed inside of Notion.
Charts help visualizeOKRs, making it easier to track progress, enhance decision-making, and improve accountability. By analyzing trends and communicating goals clearly, teams can stay agile and keep leadership informed without creating an additional burden of reporting.
----
You might consider creating a bar chart of OKR status by team to identify and mitigate potential risks. Similarly, a line chart of key result progress over time can help identify which teams have momentum, and those that might be slowing down.
Charts offer a strategic view of yourproduct roadmap, enabling your team to allocate resources efficiently and prioritize features with precision. By visualizing upcoming features and their timelines, you can ensure that your team stays on track and meets key milestones, ultimately leading to a more streamlined and effective development process.
If you manage yourcontent calendarin Notion, you can use charts to understand both in progress and published content at a glance.
----
You might use a line chart track content scheduling and publishing to maintain a consistent release schedule. This helps identify delays or inconsistencies in your workflow.
At the same time, you can visualize content distribution by tagging pieces based on channel in a bar chart. This ensures that each audience segment receives the appropriate amount of content and could help you refactor plans to make sure all of your audience’s needs are met.
While this guide covered the bulk of what you need to know to get started, the possibilities for using charts are pretty endless, especially when combined with other project management features in Notion. Here are a few more advanced ways to use charts in your workspace:
----
Turn synced databases into a chart —Synced databasespull information from tools like Jira, Asana, and GitHub into your Notion workspace to let you visualize 3rd party tasks as a Notion database. Consider turning these synced databases into charts so that your project manager can get a view of what’s happening across all of these different tools in one glance.
Visualize AI-generated content tags —WithAI autofill, you can generate tags for every row in your database based on page content in seconds. Why not use charts to visualize those tags? This makes for quick exploration of large data sets with very little work to audit and tag your data in the first place.
----
Embed charts from different data sources in your dashboard —You canembedcharts from external data sources such as Tableau, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics into Notion. Add these alongside the charts you’re using for project tracking to create a comprehensive view of your team’s performance, without leaving the Notion app.

Notion's collaboration features allow teams to work asynchronously, reducing the need for numerous meetings and real-time chats.
In a Notion database page, you can use the discussion section at the top for general feedback, and comments on specific content for more tactical feedback.
To notify a particular teammate of , just@-mentionthem in a comment. They’ll automatically receive a notification that they were mentioned in your comment, and can even respond directly from the Inbox menu.
If you have a suggestion for different wording, you can highlight your text in red for clear visual feedback.
----
By actively using comments and discussions in Notion, teams can streamline their workflow, reduce the number of meetings, and increase productivity.
"Updates" is now "Inbox"
We're always working to improve your Notion experience. Recently, the "Updates" menu in the sidebar changed to "Inbox." This new experience has a better look and feel, and improved workflows for triaging notifications. Happy collaborating!

Connect your tools to Notion with the API
We believe that if every business and person can tailor software to their problems, the world will be better at solving its problems. Notion’s mission is to make this a ubiquitous reality.
With the launch of our API, you’ll be able to customize Notion even further — teams and developers can build powerful integrations that connect Notion to the tools and workflows they use every day. This opens up a whole new set of problem-solving capabilities for Notion users.
The API unlocks an initial set of capabilities, setting the foundation for future additions. Teams at Zapier, Typeform, and Automate.io are building integrations you can use to bring information from disparate apps together in Notion.
----
To start building with the API, visitdevelopers.notion.com
The API allows developers to connect other software to Notion or automate workflows within Notion through integrations.
For example, sales teams might connect Salesforce to Notion — every time a deal is closed in Salesforce, it’s automatically added to a Notion database so you can manage these accounts cross-functionally on Notion (with teams who aren’t using Salesforce). Or your engineering team might build an integration that connects Jira to Notion, so bug tickets can be pulled into a database where all teams can see what's being worked on.
These integrations take siloed information from different tools and centralizes them in Notion for better, more effective work between teams.
----
And to make the API as accessible as possible, it is available to all Notion users.
The API allows for programmatic interaction with databases, pages, and content within Notion. This is done through a series of endpoints — places where the API is communicating and working with Notion to collect and organize information from other sources (like apps). Your team can build or use pre-built integrations to automate workflows for more efficient work.
Here’s a high-level overview of what the API can do:
For databases—databasesare core to how information is stored in Notion. With the API, you can pull specific database entries, search a list of specific database entries based on properties, and get a list of all entries in a database.
----
For pages & blocks—blockscomprise Notion pages, allowing you to customize pages depending on your needs, whether in a team wiki or part of a database. The API enables you to create new pages (in a database or in another page), set page properties, or retrieve page properties based on specific requests. You can even create new blocks in those pages and pull all the blocks from a page.
For people in your workspace— for teams of all sizes, seeing admins, members, and guests in your workspace helps foster transparency. With Notion’s API, you can get a list of all workspace users. We recommend taking advantage ofSCIMto programmatically create and remove members from your workspace.
----
Visit ourdeveloper hubfor a deep dive on how to build and use specific integrations.
Want to see what can be built with Notion’s API? Our partners are already building custom integrations and workflows that bring information from many apps together in Notion.
Zapier automatically moves information between Notion and other applications you use every day. It already supports thousands of other apps, such as Slack, Jira, Salesforce, and more.
Using Zapier, you can create automated workflows that cement Notion as your team’s information hub. For example, you can centralize new sales deals, advertising metrics, or website analytics in Notion with no need for your team to manually copy the information over.

A connected workspace for product teams to collaborate, ideate and launch
As a product manager, you sit at the intersection of engineering, design, and marketing. Each team has its own tools and processes, which sometimes results in a lack of visibility into what anyone else is working on.
In Notion, work and documentation are intertwined. You can collaborate across teams with clarity about what everyone is working on. Instead of jumping back and forth between tools, you can manage every aspect of your work - from projects, tasks, and documents to note-taking, wikis and roadmaps. You can even embed work happening into other tools directly into your Notion pages.
----
In this guide, we’ll show you how to create a home for all your product team’s work in Notion.
Building a Notion workspace means you can reduce the number of specialist tools you need - and please your finance team by reducing your subscriptions for the tools you do keep. This is because, with Notion, work that happens in other tools need not stay hidden there.
Inside a project page, for example, you can embed files, images, videos, and even sync content from GitHub, Jira, Figma and more, bringing work from those tools into your project where everyone can see the latest version.
----
This simplifies your workflow, and instead of context-switching throughout the day, you can create a more productive environment that helps everyone stay in their flow state.
It’s much easier for team members to find the information they need to make progress. Everything is organized logically in one tool, and people know where to look.
So, let’s take a look at some ideal Notion use cases for your product team.
Your product team’s knowledge base is where all team members will go to find information relevant to their work and role.
SOPs, guidelines, quarterly goals, training resources, onboarding materials, your team directory, and more can live here.
----
You can create your team homepage by creating top-level pages and sub-pages and arranging it all in a wiki layout. Then, go to the options menu and clickTurn to Wiki. This adds another layer of features to your wiki - you can assign properties to pages, view information in different layouts (table, list, etc.), and also enablesPage Verificationwhich lets team members know the information contained in a page is current.
Discover how to build a team or company wikihere.
Verify your wiki documents
----
When you turn your knowledge into a wiki, all pages will have a verification property. Page owners can verify a document for 30 days, 90 days or indefinitely. This helps you keep wiki content up to date - when verification expires, you’ll receive a notification.Learn more about wikis and page verificationhere.
Solid documentation helps keep everyone up to speed and standardizes your work and processes.
With a docs database in Notion, you can
Standardize docs and boost efficiency with templates— You can create database templates for familiar docs like PRDs, RFCs, Project Kickoffs and more. This means you can recreate documents quickly, and keeps your documentation standardized and complete.
----
Categorize documents in helpful ways— You can use a select or multi-select to tag docs according to their type. then you can always filter the database to show certain kinds of docs so you can always find what you need.
Collaborate seamlessly in a document— If you’re working on a RFC or similar collaborative document, you can invite team members to leave comments on specific blocks throughout the page, or start a discussion in the comments section at the top.
Make documents engaging with different elements on one page— Notion pages are fully customizable. Organize blocks of text into columns, headers, and bullets, embed videos, images, or links, and even sync content from other tools.
----
Draft documents in a flash with Notion AI– In just a few minutes, you can draft and edit a product document that might have previously taken hours. Hit the spacebar to call up Notion AI in any page.
Duplicate ourdocs database templateinto your workspace to get started.

Many project management tools just link out to your work. But, in Notion, work and task management live side by side.
You can use ourProjects & taskstemplate to create two project management databases that are ready to use.
----
Not only can you assign daily tasks and oversee their completion - you can connect these tasks to larger initiatives in your projects database.
Here are some tips for task and project management in Notion:
See how daily tasks relate to projects— You can use arelation propertyto create a 2-way link between your tasks and your projects. This means you can connect tasks to the project they relate to, so you’ll always know what steps are required to complete your projects.
----
Split large tasks into small manageable steps—  Breaking daunting tasks down into individual steps is project management 101. This will make your projects more manageable and clear, and let you assign tasks to different team members. Split projects into tasks, and then, usesub-tasks and dependenciesto divide tasks into smaller action steps and see how they connect to one another.
----
View tasks and projects in different ways depending on context— Notion databases can be arranged in many different layouts like board view, table, list, timeline and calendar. In the same database block, you can have a table view showing all your projects, a board view organized by project status, and a timeline view showing how different commitments intersect. Learn about database viewshere.
See sub-sets of information useful in certain contexts—Filter and sortyour databases to show sub-sets of information, such as all projects where certain team members are involved or all tasks due in the next week.
----
View your database in different places— Createlinked databasesanywhere in the workspace to resurface your information in another place. For example, you can create a linked version of the tasks database in your own private page, then filter this linked database to show all tasks that are assigned to you.
Roadmaps help your product team track sprints, epics, and fix bugs - in other words, get all the pieces into place for your next big launch.
They’re a vital tool for cross-functional collaboration, where you set priorities and get everyone on the same trajectory.
Get started with ourRoadmap template- here are some things you can do:
----
Link your roadmap to tasks and projects— Build stronger connections between daily work and larger initiatives.
Get everyone aligned with launch dates—  A roadmap gives everyone a chance to see what’s up next on the launch calendar and set their priorities.
Use a timeline to scope out work— Create atimeline viewof your roadmap, so you can easily see how all your commitments overlap.
Report bugs with abutton— Reporting bugs to the engineering team need not be a lengthy process. Create a button (on your product team’s homepage, for example) where your team members can instantly “Report a Bug.” Clicking the button will create a new database entry that they can customize and save.
----
Plan your weekly sprints and scrums— Consult your roadmap to review the week’s priorities before you plan your weekly sprints and scrums. You can even add a linked version of the Roadmap into the template for those meetings so it’s always easy to access.
When teams collaborate, relying on emails and messages for communication isn’t enough. Sometimes, you have to bring everyone into a meeting to get aligned and agree on next steps.
For meetings to be productive, you need a shared space to outline agendas, take notes, and create action items that won’t get forgotten.
With ourmeeting notes template, you can create a database to help you have more productive meetings that move you closer to your objectives.
----
Using the meeting notes database, you can:
Automatically create entries for recurring meetings— Create a meeting template for a regular meeting - like sprint kickoff or your daily standup - with a space for your agenda, notes, and actions. Then, turn that into arepeating templatethat will recreate weekly, once every two weeks, or once a month, for example.
Link meetings to their relevant projects— With a relation property, link your meeting notes with projects. Then you can tag meetings with the relevant project, which helps make all context about a project easy to access.
----
Revisit past meetings to see what was discussed and agreedupon— Instead of forgetting what was talked about after the meeting is over, your team members can go back and review past meetings and their outcomes.
Catch up with anything you’ve missed—  Use a person property to tag everyone who attends a meeting. If one of your team members has been away, they can filter the database to show meetings where they aren’t tagged and quickly get up to speed with what they missed.
----
Add tasks and action items straight to your database— Instead of just writing down action items, send them straight to the tasks database with one click.Create a buttonin the meeting note template to add new items to your task database. You can add any new tasks immediately and even fill out some properties on the go.
Your product team’s toolkit for projects, tasks, docs, and meeting notes
Use connected databases to manage projects, tasks, documents, and meeting notes - learn more inthis guide.
Notion lets you create a workspace where your product team can work, find useful resources, collaborate, and share information with other teams.
----
You can design this workspace according to how your team works best - here are some ways to build smart connections throughout your workspace:
Use buttons to automate and simplify processes— You can create buttons anywhere in the workspace which allow you to automatically generate blocks in the page, or add and edit database items. Buttons can help speed up and simplify complex workflows - learn how to use buttonshere.
View the same content in multiple places— By creatinglinked databases, you can resurface database content (or a filtered subset of the content) anywhere. You can alsosync blocks— blocks of text, tables, and more. When you duplicate them, you can edit all the instances at once.
----
Bring all relevant content into your OKRs page— When you’re working towards a goal, you can bring all relevant content into yourOKRs page, from related projects and tasks to meetings and documents. It’s easier to see your progress and keep everyone on track.
Plug content from other tools into Notion— You can bridge the gap between product, engineering, design teams, and more using integrations. You canembed contentfrom a wide variety of tools directly into your Notion pages and even createsynced databasesfrom tools like Jira and Github to give your team total clarity.
----
Collaborate effortlessly using mentions— Use the @ tag tomention pages, people, or datesanywhere on the page to instantly connect with someone. You can also comment and tag people on pages and specific blocks.

Create and use an upvote formula for team decisions
It’s important for teams of all sizes (remote teams in particular!) to ensure their employees’ voices are heard. That can be hard on a shared Zoom call with triple-digit attendees.
Whether it’s selecting the most urgent questions to discuss at the next all-hands meeting or an engineering team voting on which product feature should be next in line for development, an upvote formula in your database lets everyone play a role in decision-making.
----
This provides managers with transparency into what matters most to their team, so they can take their views into account when making big decisions. Creating a database for team-wide voting and decision-making helps individuals feel valued and included in the most important aspects of your product or your business.
Think about all the times you’ve had teammates raise their hands to vote on something, or tried picking through feedback from a chat window or Slack thread. This upvote database comes in handy whenever you want people to suggest new ideas or share their opinions — and it might help you prioritize based on what your team’s voting on most.
Here are a few situations where teams will find upvotes useful.
----
Vote for questions to tackle at all-hands meetings— All-hands meetings can get chaotic, especially as your organization grows. It can be tough to stay focused and cover what matters to your team. To prepare for the meeting, attendees can enter questions into a database, the entire team can vote on the questions, and those with the highest votes will get answered. You can even take notes directly inside the question pages, so that those answers can be referred back to later.
----
Decide which product feature to build next— Your product team likely has tons of ideas for new features, and it’s important to have a database to record all these suggestions. Before deciding which features your team will build next, have everyone vote. This way, distributed teammates are accounted for, and it helps frame your discussion (instead of a free-for-all where you’ve got to go through every idea). You can even broaden the upvoting, allowing other teams across the organization to vote, leveraging their experience with users or potential customers.
----
Log user feedback— Listening to what your users say can help you find ways to improve and solve problems. Create a database so your customer support team has a place to log feedback they receive from users. When another teammate encounters the same feedback, they can tag themselves, thus addressing the most frequent user issues.
Vote on branding decisions— designers who’ve been immersed in a rebranding project for a while will appreciate some external input when it comes to making final decisions on which designs make the cut. When you’ve narrowed it down to a few options, you can create agallery databaseshowcasing all your designs, build in an upvote feature, and invite the rest of your organization to choose their favorites.
----
You can use an upvote to collect team sentiment and quickly organize or prioritize your work based on the votes. It helps foster communication and ensure that team members get the chance to have a say in what happens in your organization.
Here’s how to create your own upvote database for All-hands questions database, where team members submit and vote on questions to cover in upcoming meetings.
Create a table database where you’ll add all the items you want people to vote on.
Next, add aCreated byproperty. This will automatically populate with the person who creates the database entry. You’ll see we’ve renamed thisAsked byto show that this is who's suggesting the question.
----
Add aPersonproperty, and call itUpvoted by. People will tag themselves in this column to vote on ideas.
Now add aFormulaproperty, click on the property and selectEdit formula. In the formula editor, you can paste the following:
length(prop("Upvoted by")) /* or you can write this as: */prop("Upvoted by").length()
This formula will add up the number of people tagged in theUpvoted bycolumn and display that as a number.
Tag yourself in the upvote column to vote for questions and bring those with the most votes to the top.
Learn more about formulas
Click to expand
----
When you use this formula, the default number of upvotes will appear as one, which assumes that whoever created the suggestion also votes in favor of it. Every time someone else tags themselves in the “Upvoted By” column, it will add one to the total count of upvotes.
It makes sense to sort your database so that the pages with the most votes are at the top. To do this, clickSortin the top right of the database and+ Add a sort. From the dropdown, chooseUpvotesand selectDescending.
----
Plus — you wouldn’t want already-answered questions to appear in your database. To help you focus on questions that need attention, add aSelectproperty to assign tags such as “Answered” and “Unanswered.” Same goes for features you’ve built. You could assignSelectproperties for “Built” or “Next up” or “Being considered.”
Then, you could filter your database to only show questions that need answering. ClickFilterin the database menu. From the dropdown, choose yourStatusproperty, selectisandUnanswered. Now, answered questions won’t show up in this view, but they’ll still be safely stored in the database. Just be sure to assign “Answered” to questions you...answer.

Create a hybrid work hub
As the world and workplace adapt to guidance surrounding COVID-19, many workplaces are navigating conversations around hybrid working environments where some employees work remotely, while others work in an office space. One of the most important things for the success of a hybrid model is clear communication and expectation setting across all employees.
When information is organized and accessible for your team, you empower them to do their best work, wherever they are, and wherever they want to be. Processes, philosophies, and guidelines live in one place and can be easily updated, which is especially important in a landscape where the ground is shifting constantly.
----
Give your teams one easy place to access all of this information with a rockstar wiki. This acts as the single-source of truth for teams navigating a new way of work.
Guidelines and philosophies— bring together the many, many emails and updates about working environment into one single-source of truth. Clearly outline expectations for office workers and remote workers, and those who do a little bit of both — like when to change your Slack status, for example. Where you can,communicate philosophiesbehind decisions so that employees can understand the company vision.
----
Health and safety measures— this will be top of mind for many employees. Your company likely already has documentation around the important work you're doing to keep folks safe, so make sure it is linked here for all to read. (If you're not familiar withbacklinks, this would be a great place to use them). You can even includePDFs or embedded web pageshere to share external resources, like local, state, or global guidelines.
Zoom backgrounds— don't forget your remote friends when designing a hybrid work hub. Foster unity and culture by distributing "official" company zoom backgrounds for all types of occasions.
Is your team working entirely remotely?
Click to expand
----
Hybrid work requires an intentional operational shift not only from the days before the pandemic, but also from the "normal" of the past year and a half. Often, it takes some upfront work to build these systems but once you do, the payoff is immense for your teammates working anywhere in the world.
Notion databases are the way to go here. Not only do they organize work, they also act as a place to do the work — each cell opens up into its own page. Teammates can see what’s happening at a high level, and dig deeper inside pages if they want more info. This helps sow transparency between individuals and teams.
----
Reserve desks, conference rooms, and other equipment— between health and safety measures and team growth, many groups are working in capacity-constrained spaces. Ensure everyone has the equipment they need for work by creating a sign-up system for desks and conference rooms. Try using alinked databaseandformulasfor extra texture to keep track of special requests like ultra-wide monitors, accessible seating options, or after-hours access.
Collect lunch orders— create a single calendar for office events and lunches so people can order ahead of time. This also helps create consistency in process so no one ends up left out because they missed that one important Slack message.
----
Detail daily procedures— a list is a nice way to package need-to-know information like what to do if you're the first one to arrive at the office, or the last one to leave. You can include information on greeting visitors, requesting snacks, and more. Because it's a database under the hood, you can add properties likeresponsible team member,updated time,location, and more to better organize information.
Link to your company directory— if you have multiple offices, consider adding avisitingproperty to your people directory, and adding a filtered view in your environment hub so that resident employees can stay connected.
All things databases!
Click to expand
----
Your digital working environment should be as dynamic as your physical one. Invite employees into the conversation with embedded elements and automations.
Request feedback in an embedded Typeform— you’re doing your best to make the environment work for everyone. Try including an anonymous feedback form inline so that you can better understand employee engagement.  Simply use the/typeformcommand to get started.
----
Connect to a Slack channel— things change! That's ok. Keep the company up to date by setting up automatic Slack notifications for updates to key documents. Remember that health & safety guidelines page? Don't leave employees to wonder how your company is responding to changing regulations - set up an@channelthat triggers when updates are made to your page.
----
Create a poll for an upcoming event— ask questions at all hands with a "Q&A" database. Not only does this help remote workers stay connected, it promotes equity across all environments ensuring that every voice is heard. Using databases, add a people property for "upvoted by" add a second property with this formula to tally the number of votes(if(empty(prop("🔺 Upvoted By")), toNumber(""), length(prop("🔺 Upvoted By")) - length(replaceAll(prop("🔺 Upvoted By"), ",", "")) + 1).

Schedule virtual events— use a calendar (and create a list view) to advertise virtual events like happy hours and workshops. Consider usingZapierorautomate.ioto integrate google calendar with Notion and store extra details about the event in a linked location.
Show off office tunes— if your team contains music connoisseurs, consider sharing your favorite playlists inside Notion. Play them at team meet-ups, or before your next all-hands!
Create a reading/watching list— use theNotion Web Clipperto add insightful articles to a shared database. Or, do the same thing with your favorite binge-worthy TV shows that are captivating lunch table conversation. This makes it easier for employees in all locations to form genuine, human connections.

Creating a knowledge hub by organizing docs for large teams
Notion can act as your team’s central knowledge hub.
Create a home page for every team in your company, and use it to store processes, best practices, or OKRs.
Inside a Notion page, create headings and subheadings, or add a table of contents at the top to make information more digestible.
To link to another page,@-mentionthe page, and select its name in the dropdown. Any time you link a page, a backlink will be added to the page you linked.
You may also sync sections of pages across multiple locations in your workspace. If you do, the changes made to your content, whether in the original page or here, will be updated in real time.
----
Creating standardized databases can be extremely beneficial to leaders who need to get a bird's eye view, and employees who want to better understand what others are working on.
Keep a Docs database that stores procedural knowledge, or how-to guides. Add all the views, sorts, and filters your teams need to make sense of the data.
Create a Meeting Notes database to store the notes taken during all meetings held at the company, making it easy for anyone to see what was discussed asynchronously. Try building a database template for recurrent meetings like weekly syncs.
Finally, go to a page’sSharemenu to restrict a page’s access, fromFull AccesstoNo Accessat all. You can also invite external guests to a page.

Creating links & backlinks
As your Notion workspace grows, links and backlinks make it easy to connect related pages.
To create a link, hit the opening bracket key twice, start typing the name of the page you want to link to, and select the page when it shows up. This will automatically create a backlink at the top of your page.
When you click on any of these backlinks, you’ll be automatically taken to the part of the text where the page was mentioned.
Backlinks help you discover related pages about specific topics. They're like your very own “references" section, one that is created automatically.
Links in Notion are dynamic and update themselves. If you change a page's title or icon, every link to that page will automatically update.

Database properties help organize your team’s information
Properties are the backbone of databases. They help you organize the pages in your database based on criteria you decide.
Want to make sure projects all get a deadline? There's a property for that. Want to assign a project manager? Property for that too. What about tagging the type of project? Yep, properties do that.
With properties, you can get a snapshot view of information associated with each page in a database — and maybe even more importantly, filter data based on different property types.
----
There are a couple of ways to add a property: within a database page or by selectingPropertieson the top right of your database. Click+ Add a propertyin either scenario, name the property, and select the type you want. Let's get into how to use them.
Better databases have arrived!
While the concepts outlined in this guide are still useful, references to specific product actions may be a bit outdated! Databases were redesigned in March 2022, so your experience may differ slightly from what’s pictured and described here.This guideoutlines the new database features, including what's changed.
----
While databases can house everything from engineering sprints to content calendars, there are key properties that are table stakes for most Notion databases. These help tell you what’s happening, who’s responsible, and when it’s due (or just about anything else you need to know about a database page).
Here are some of the basic properties you can use to organize almost every database:
Name— in a table database, the first column shows "Name" at the top. This is where you'll name the pages that go in your database. Each page also contains all the page’s properties and lets you store information like drafts, images, code, and more.
----
Select— customize how you tag projects in a database, like by priority, project type, teams, or status. Maybe HR has anapplicant tracking database. Use aSelectproperty to assign stages, like "Onsite Interview“ or "Offer.“ You can quickly create new tags by clicking on the cell for the property. And any tags you've created will show up as a dropdown list to choose from.
Multi-select— this is just like aSelectproperty, but you can assign multiple attributes to a page. Going back to the applicant tracking example, you can add aMulti-selectproperty called “Skills” for all the proficiencies you gathered from a candidate’s resume and interviews.
----
Person— tag teammates with this property, whether they're the project owner or participating in some regard. This ensures everyone knows who's responsible for what.
Date— set deadlines or establish a start and end date for completing your project. Yourengineering teammight use date properties for feature launches, but also for the two-week sprints to build these features. You can set each of these separately, thencreate a timeline vieworganized by ship dates and execution dates.

For example, you might group a board by project manager (aPersonproperty) to see what everyone has on their plates. You might also want to group pages by their status (aSelectproperty) like "Not started“ or "In progress.“ Makingmultiple database viewswith this information also helps you get a quick download of projects based on what you need.
Together, these properties give your team a simple way to organize large sets of information.
Create views to surface relevant database information

Add a little more texture to your properties by using them to hold all the materials you might need as part of the work at hand.
----
Files & media— upload relevant files right into this property. For example, you can add the hero images for any blog posts or social media content and display it ingallery view. Using a property for this information also makes it easy to download, instead of needed to find it in the body of the pages.
Text— use a text property to summarize a page's content or provide high-level details. That way, you can quickly grab the essential information right from the database instead of dipping into the page itself. Your sales team might use this property to give a couple lines about your competitors in an audit to reference during sales calls.
----
Checkbox— ensure project owners complete specific items. If you develop SEO-polished content, add checkboxes to ensure writers hit the target keywords, use internal links, and other on-page optimizations. Thenadd a filterwhere unchecked items don’t show in your database. That way, you see in seconds what content still needs work.
URL, Email, Phone— quickly follow up with prospects by including every lead’s contact information into your CRM databases (and here's aCRM templateyou can use!).
Maybe you want to connect two databases, or see when a page in a database was last edited. These advanced properties help your team get the most out of databases.
----
Relations— connect two databases together withrelationsto get the full picture of your work. For example, your product team might be launching a new feature, with all the information housed in a page in your roadmap database. You can use a relation to connect your roadmap to a database of your team’s meeting notes, meaning all relevant meetings about that project are accessible right on the project’s page.
Rollups—  this helps your aggregate data based on relations. Let's say you have a database of tasks that need to be completed prior to releasing a new feature, with each task having a checkbox. You can rollup these tasks to see the progress being made toward launch. Learn more aboutrollups.
----
Created time— as soon as a page is created, this will timestamp it with the date and time. This helps when you're cleaning up a database to remove outdated project specs or research guidelines.
Created by— see who created pages, which helps when you're organizing pages based on their creators. For example, you can use this property to filter meeting notes based on the ones you drafted.
Last edited time & by— auto-populate the timestamp that a page was last edited (and by who). When you’re project managing a page where many people are collaborating, this can be especially helpful.
----
Formula— show progress on a project, get votes on questions for your next all-hands meeting, calculate taxes, and more byinserting formulas into your database. They allow your team to run calculations and functions based on other properties.
Like your favorite jacket, you may not need certain database properties around all the time, but you want them handy.
Toggle on/off properties depending on what you want to see by hittingPropertiesat the top of your database. You can also use these in different views — like in your project roadmap you might only want to see the DRI and launch date properties, or in your calendar view, you may only need to see the project type.
----
To further customize your properties, you can choose which ones arehidden or visible. Inside your database’s project pages, hit the⋮⋮to the left of the property and chooseHide property. Here, you can select whether the property is always visible, always hidden, or only visible when it’s in use.

Databases reimagined— what’s changed?
Inaccessible information isn’t usable. Tasks, notes, personal goals, work goals — this information needs to be easy to find, referenced in multiple places, and visualized whatever way helps you be more productive. Notion databases make this possible, but there’s always room for improvement. So we reimagined databases from the ground up, and now they’re more powerful than ever.
If you’re like us, you use databases for just about everything — managing meeting notes, projects, documentation and more. In this guide we’ll break down what’s new with databases, and how you can make the most of them — on your own, or with a team.
Here’s what’s new with databases:
----
Quick filters—  make it easy to limit the items you see in a database view, and any changes you make to filters and sorts of shared database views won’t affect other people on the team until you clickSave for everyone.
Select a data source— now when you create a new database or view, you’ll see an option to select a data source, making it easy to include synced content from other databases in your workspace.
Streamlined design— find all your customization options like filters, sorts, groupings, and more, in oneView optionsmenu. Plus, quickly access your views by switching between tabs at the top of your database. Fewer clicks between you and displaying information in whatever way makes sense to your brain.
----

Notion experts have known about the power of linked databases for years, and we want to make it more accessible to all.
Every time you create a new database or view, you’ll be given the option to select an existing data source from the workspace. We recommend using just a few core database for day-to-day operations of your work and life, rather than a whole bunch of smaller databases. For teams, meeting notes, tasks, and docs tend to be a good place to start. Then, when you want to reference or add that information somewhere else in your workspace you simply make a new view of the existing database.
----
If you’re used to exclusively creating databases from scratch you might be wondering what circumstances are best to take advantage of existing data sources. Here’s a few guiding principles. Generally speaking, you should sync an existing data source when:
----
You want to consolidate disparate information— we often see people create new databases for their team, even when the framework already exists elsewhere in their workspace. Instead of trying to remember if last week’s project launch meeting notes live in the marketing database, or in engineering database, you can simply make use of one, company-wide database called “meeting notes” and createviewsin each team page’s hub. This way you have clarity and synergy at all levels — up, down, and across your org chart.
----
You want to use the same properties from another database— if you want to organize a list of meetings, with participants, date, and more, there’s no use in setting up six identical “meeting notes” databases with slightly different names. That’s what tags and filters are for. Instead, have one source of notes and utilize tags and views to denote specific team or project-based meetings. This helps keep you organized, and with a bigger group, can make it abundantly clear when there’s an unnecessary redundancy in work.
----
An existing view living elsewhere in your workspace would be helpful— views are now re-usable when you create a new linked instance. No more manually recreating the filters, sorts and other customization in every new linked instance! If you’re ever finding yourself wanting to recreate a view structure, it’s probably best just to pull that original data source in and add a few properties for your new project.
What about linked databases?
Click to expand
----
For the first time, you can use views of different data sources inside one block. This means that you can display endless amounts of information without taking up more space on your page, and it makes it easier for collaborators to connect the dots between otherwise loosely connected pieces of information. In addition, you can now display these views as tabs, so it’s easier to find what you’re looking for.
----
Connect multiple data sources into one place— let’s say you have one database of “companies” that your sales team is in contact with and another of “contacts” at those companies. Previously, you would have had to display each database separately, maybe inline on a page. Now you can pull all of those bits of information together into one place — easier access to the information that matters!
Copy views from the source— we all have our go-to database views, curated perfectly to our needs. When you select a data source from elsewhere in your Notion workspace, you’ll have the option to chose a view from the original location and all of view options will be automatically applied.
----
Tabs make it easier to find information— oftentimes, you don’t know what you’re missing until you see it. Rather than hiding displays with differing layouts, sorts and filters inside of a dropdown menu, you can now make use of tabs to draw attention to your most important views.
Go further to link information together
Click to expand
All your favorite database customization options — filters, sorts, grouping & more — are now consolidated in a unifiedView optionsmenu. As we’ve added features to our databases, we realized a need for a totally revamped menu, so that’s what we created. In it, you’ll find the options you’re used to seeing across the top of your database —layout,properties,filter, andsort.
----
Layouts help you see data in new ways— Notion lets you visualize your data as a table, calendar, timeline, list, board, or gallery.
Properties let you add detail— within a view like a table you might want to see all of your properties listed in one place. Sometimes though, it’s helpful to isolate just a few bits of key information. The properties option lets you toggle properties on and off so that you can focus on what matters. You might want to know information about priority on your per person board view, but could toggle it off on your launch calendar.
----
Filters let you isolate information based on properties— as you lean into using a few centralized databases to manage your day to day, filters will become extremely useful. You can isolate information by any kind of property including tag or person. That way you only see the information you need at that moment. Like for example, just blog posts where the status is “published.”
Sort and group for even more tailored management— sometimes you don’t want to flip through several views to see information. In these cases, consider grouping your content, like by publication status or author, to get a three dimensional birds eye view of what everyone is working on.

----
Finally, filters are easier and faster to create — they require less clicks and feel more modern. Instead of creating a new view for yourself to find that one small piece of information, you can add a “quick filter” that is viewable only by you until you hit “Save for everyone”.
This change also means that Filter groups, often too clunky for day to day use, are no longer the default. These filter groups still exist under the “advanced” filter option for when you need them, but they’re out of sight (and mind) when you don’t.
----
We often say that databases are like intelligent filing cabinets. Unlike filing cabinets that sit in your home collecting dust, your Notion databases are continuously improving. We hope these database improvements make it easier for you to manage all of the bits and pieces of information in your work, and life.

A documents database tailored for product teams
With our template, you can create a tailor-made docs database for your product team to organize information and collaborate seamlessly on documents like RFCs, PRDs and more.
If you’re looking for a way to cement your team’s documentation process and keep everything consistent, this docs database for product teams is for you. We’ll show you how to use our template to catalog your team’s knowledge, create custom templates for product-specific documents, and give you some tips on mapping out your Notion pages.
To add the docs template to your workspace, go toTemplatesin the sidebar, select or search forDocs, and clickGet template.
In the database template you’ll find:
----
Helpful properties for documentation— Dynamic properties will show you when a document was created, when it was last edited, and by who. There’s also a multi-select property so you can categorize documents according to topic (engineering, guides, etc)
Saved views for different contexts— As well as a table view showing all documents, there’s a list view for recently edited items, a table where documents are grouped by category, and a “Mine” view which shows any pages you’ve created or recently edited.
----
Templates for quickly creating new docs— Click on the drop-down arrow next toNewand you’ll find templates for Product Spec (PRD), Brainstorm and Technical Spec. To edit these templates, click...next to the template and make your changes in the page. You can choose a template as the default new database item, or schedule
repeating templates.

You can start using the template out of the box and customize it with properties, views, filters and more.
Here are some suggestions for upgrading your docs database.
----
With database templates you can quickly create new database entries with certain properties and key information already filled out on the page.
An RFC (Request for Comment) is a type of feature spec document where you summarize the what, why and how of a feature you’re proposing to build, and invite your team to comment and give feedback.
To create an RFC template in your database, go to the dropdown next toNewand click+ New template. Once you’ve edited the page, you’ll be able to create a new RFC by going to the dropdown and selecting your template.
Database templates
----
Templates let you generate new database pages based on a predesigned format, so all you have to do is fill in the blanks. Learn more about creating and editing database templateshere.
Your RFC template might contain different sections to summarize the feature summary, and describe the reasoning behind the proposal, your method, the pros and cons, potential impact and any unresolved questions.
Show_RFCAnother useful template for your docs database is a PRD (Product Requirement Document). A PRD helps you plan, design and develop new products and features in collaboration with your team, and you’ll find one ready to use in the database’s template menu.
In your PRD template, you can add sections where you’ll outline:
----
The problem you want to solve, and why— Explain what problem you are solving, for who, and why it matters for your users.
How you propose to solve the problem— What action will you take to solve the problem, and why did you land on that solution?
Your action steps or plan for solving the problem— What are you going to build, and how will you measure the success of the new feature? You can outline each step required.
You could add more sections to define the project goals and KPIs, note any limitations, assumptions, dependencies that exist, etc. You could even include a linked copy of your tasks database showing tasks related to this project.
Take a look at thisPRD templatefor more inspiration.
----
You can create any templates you want for your product team, for all kinds of document your team uses on a regular basis.
You can add as many properties as you need to your docs database.
The following properties might be useful:
Tag docs with a specific doc type— Use the suggested propertyDoc typeto categorize your document as a Product Spec, RFC, etc.
Relate documents to your projects, tasks or meeting notes— Add a relation to other databases to link your documentation to task management and conversations with your team.
Use a rollup to show how many incomplete tasks are left to do— Once you’ve related your docs to your tasks database, you can use a rollup property to show how many incomplete tasks relate to a particular document.
----
Give documents a status like To Do, In Progress or Complete— Use the Status property to indicate what stage the document is at. You can also add secondary status tags like “Waiting”, “Blocked” etc.
Learn more about database propertieshere.
Databases can come in many forms, and you can create multiple views for different contexts. To create a new view in your database, click the+button next to your existing views. This will bring up a menu where you can name your view and choose the type of layout you want.
In addition to the views already existing in the template, you could create:
A view showing all docs that need to be reviewed— Create a new view and call it “To Review”. Then, click onFilterbyStatusand select “In Review”.
----
A board database grouped by status— Add a board database view, and underGroup byselectStatus. Now, you’ll see all your documents to do in a helpful kanban layout.
A list database showing each type of document— When you start to have a lot of items in the database, you can create separate saved views filtered to show each type of document. So, if you wanted to look through all your RFCs, you can open up that view.
A calendar view organizing docs by their due date— You can add another date property to give documents a due date. Create a calendar view, then under
Show calendar byselect the due date property.
You can read more about views, filters and ways to sort your databasehere.
----
You can customize pages in your database with all different kinds of blocks that will make them both visually appealing and engaging.
Use headers and dividers to create different sections— Dividing your documents into sections will make the information more digestible and help you scan for what you need.
Highlight a piece of text by turning it into a callout— You can use callouts for instructions, or quick explanations and summaries of the page
Add bullet points and checklists for notes and tasks to do— Make your action steps clear with a bulleted list or to-do list where you can check items off as they get resolved.
Drag and drop text into columns— You can drag and drop text (or any other content block) to form columns in your page.
----
Insert images and videos into your page— Break up your text with visual content like images and videos, either by uploading a file or embedding a link.
Embed content from tools like Jira, Github, Asana and more— Integrate your Notion account with other tools and paste content from those tools directly into database page for full visibility into your team’s work. Learn more about embeds here.

Embeds in Notion: A comprehensive guide for teams
Notion allows users to embed various apps, such as Google Drive, Google Maps, PDFs, YouTube videos, Typeform forms, and Loom videos, directly into their Notion pages.
Embedding Google Drive files is as simple as pasting the file link.
Add a Google Maps address by pasting the map link. The map can be resized, and zoomed in or out.
PDFs can be embedded by uploading the file from the hard drive. They can also be attached as file blocks.
To embed a YouTube video, just paste the video link. Do the same for Loom videos. The embedded video can be played and the playback speed adjusted.
----
By the same token, you can add Typeform forms to Notion pages. Any changes made to a typeform will automatically update in the embedded form.
Notion's embedded services help users consolidate their tools and information in one place, reducing the need for switching between multiple apps and tabs.

First steps when introducing Notion to a new teammate
You already know how powerful Notion can be for wikis, project management, docs, notes and more. But your new teammate? They're not quite there ... yet.
Luckily, we can help. By giving them a few basics and places to experiment with Notion, they'll becollaborating, utilizingcomments and mentions, and contributing to your company'ssingle source of truthin no time.
If you're already a Notion user and want to help others on your team unlock the full power of Notion, use these tips to get your teammates up to speed.Are you a new Notion user looking to get started?Check out our guide onhow to join your team that's using Notion.
----
If you useNotion for onboarding, create a page as part of that process compiling all these resources, tips, and steps for new teammates. You can even add it in an onboarding template, if you're using one. This gives new users one place to access everything they'll need when it comes to using Notion.
If not, try duplicating theNotion Onboarding Templateinto your workspace!
We suggest encouraging members of your team to get to know and love the private page section of their sidebar. Think of the private page as their playground. Here they can take notes, experiment with block types, and learn about Notion, without fear of mucking up any shared pages or databases.
----
As part of creating a private page, have them watch this 8-minute video:Notion Training: The Basics. Here, they'll learn how to add and edit content, set up a workspace, and collaborate with teammates.
Once they're familiar with the basics, here's what you can tell them to do next:
Start typing! Watch this 4-minute video aboutwriting and editing basics. Go deeper withguide on block types.
Teach them about the slash command, the starting place for just about everything they'll do on a Notion page. Here's a 3-minute video that has everything they need to know aboutusing slash commands.
----
Embed some content. Whether it's dragging a photo in from the desktop, adding in a video from YouTube, or including a code snippet, embedding different kinds of content into a Notion page is a key learning point. Have them read about thedifferent types of embedsand how to use them.

Once your new teammate is familiar with some of the on-page aspects of Notion, they'll want to start contributing publicly.
Make sure they know how the information is structured in your workspace by going through these components:
----
Start with the sidebar and how it's organized. They can watch this 6-minute video aboutnavigating with the sidebar, which will teach them all about top-level pages, toggling these pages, and how they'llreceive notifications. In addition, be sure to share anything that might be unique to your team's space — like a meeting notes database, or an operating system page.
Working with your teammates is one of the things that makes Notion so powerful. Your new teammate can watch this 4-minute video aboutcomments and mentions, and have them tag you in a comment somewhere (using the@key on any block and on a page). You can even show them how to respond right in theAll Updatessection of the sidebar!
----
Part of collaboration is sharing pages with teammates. They can watch this 9-minute video aboutsharing and permissionsand read this Guide aboutsharing settings. Remember that private page they were playing in? Have them share it with you and give you the right level of access (and watch it move to theSharedsection of the sidebar).
At a more human level, it can help to explain any working norms in your organization. How do folks like to receive documents? What timeline is reasonable for feedback? Understanding these types of boundaries can help a new user feel more at home in public spaces. If you don't have norms set up, check out our guide onhow teams can use Notion for better collaboration.

Full page vs. inline databases
There are two ways to display a Notion database: inline with your other content, or full page.
Should you need to focus, full-page databases are your best option, giving you easy access to all the menus you need.
Compact and neat, inline databases can be tucked under other pages, keeping your workspace tidy. You can easily drag and drop them around your page.
If you wish, you can transform database entries into simple, non-database pages. To do this, select your entries, and drag them away from your database with your mouse.

Get answers about work content faster with Q&A
Your company’s Notion workspace stores all the information that teams and individuals rely on — product roadmaps, PTO policies, onboarding docs, and more.
Answers to important questions live inside these pages, but team members often spend longer than they should hunting for vital information.
Q&A surfaces answers immediately, so you can leverage all the information in your Notion workspace.
For employees at Remote (a global HR platform of over 1,000+ distributed teammates), it used to take 5-10 minutes to find an answer to every question, multiple times a day. They’re now using Q&A across their entire workspace to get answers in seconds.
----
Instead of digging for information and context-switching throughout the day, you can stay focused.
In this guide, we’ll show how Q&A helps everyone work faster and move forward with work independently.
Regardless of your role, function, or company size, you probably spend a fair amount of time searching for the information you need to do your work.
Even with a comprehensive knowledge base in Notion, team members don’t always know how or where to find what they need. Often, information lives in a separate place from where they’re working, or doesn’t exist in a form they can make sense of. So they ping a DM or email to a colleague and have to wait for an answer.
----
As a result, progress stalls and focus is broken. Team members are blocked until they get their answers, and the knowledge-keepers of your company are bombarded with routine questions that pull them away from more impactful work.
But Q&A acts as a personal assistant to each team member so you can spend less time searching for vital information.
Thanks to its extraordinary ability to search thousands of docs in seconds, Q&A gives team members what they need, in a fraction of the time it takes to DM your colleague and get a response.
Whenever a question about work arises, you can consult Q&A first to find out if the answer is already documented in Notion.
----
To open Q&A, click on the sparkle in the bottom right of your Notion window and start typing your request into the text box as a naturally-worded question.
Q&A can surface relevant content from pages you have access to, summarize the main takeaways from one or more pages, and even answer more complex specific questions about what the content means.
Search for mentions of a particular topic across the workspace— For example, asking Q&A to “find mentions of plans for new user education” which might surface training materials for employees.
----
Answer onboarding questions— Even the most robust onboarding page will lead to questions. Q&A is an onboarding buddy for your new hires to ask anything, from how to set up their 401k, to what to do when they get locked out of the office.
Get up to date with a meeting you missed— Couldn’t make yesterday’s standup? Ask Q&A to summarize what was discussed and find tasks assigned to you after the meeting.
----
Suggest explanations for results of a campaign— Seen unusually fast growth in one market? Q&A can help you make sense of results. Ask “why have we experienced such high organic growth in Korea?”. It can look at the results of marketing campaigns, paid ads, user research and client feedback that relates to Korea, and suggest possible explanations.
With access to all the information stored in your workspace, Q&A understands your OKRs, sprint commitments, campaign goals, and everything else you use Notion for. When you ask a question, it will provide an accurate answer from the library of information you’ve built as a company.
Q&A respects your security and privacy

Q&A makes AI a useful tool for everyone and can have a tangible impact on day-to-day work.
You can use Q&A no matter what team you’re on. Let's look at examples.
As an engineer, the last thing you want is to break your flow when you’re in the middle of fixing a complex bug.
If you need to check how something should be done, instead of contacting your manager or reading through all your lengthy process docs, you can open up Q&A and get an instant answer to your question.
Andrew Pett, Staff Backend Engineer from Remote, explained how Q&A helps surface crucial information:
----
“The benefits for using Q&A for me are speed and efficiency. If I come across a keyword or some context I’m not familiar with, Q&A is my first port of call. It’ll search the relevant documents and present information back to me in a nice little summary.”

Q&A is used to retrieve and synthesize information from various documents using natural language. It can answer your questions using data from across your entire workspace and synthesize concepts from your knowledge library, but it doesn’t have access to wider knowledge.
In addition to Q&A, Notion’s AI package also includes Writer and Autofill.
Call up Writer by hitting space in any page, and you can start drafting and editing text, generating ideas, researching a topic, and more.
----
Writer will look to the outside world for knowledge to help you draft content. It can understand the context of the page you’re currently on. You can ask it to perform actions (like summarizing) on the content of the page, but it won’t necessarily take wider workspace information into context.
Autofill is a database property that can summarize, extract insights, translate content from a database entry.
In the context of project management, it can summarize the progress of a project or task, and the results will update as new tasks are added and lifecycle changes.
It helps you glean high-level insights from a database at a glance.

To maximize the value you get from Q&A, your company’s Notion workspace needs to contain all the information your team members need to get on with their work and understand their roles.
If you’re still building out your organization’s workspace, here are some tips to bear in mind:
Create a company home or wiki containing key information about your company— Yourcompany wikimight contain process documents, company policies, your mission statement and values, and overarching goals.
Build wikis for each team— In addition to the company wiki, eachteam should have their own homepagewhere relevant resources are easy to find.
----
Use our project and task management system— You can duplicate Notion’sProjects & tasks templateinto your workspace. With projects and tasks connected, Q&A will be able to answer questions about project status and workload.
Import content from other tools— If you’ve switched from another tool, you can import content fromConfluenceorAsana, you can import your content straight into Notion in just a few clicks. You can alsocreate
synced databasesand pull information from other tools such as Github and Jira.

Get useful insights with workspace and page analytics
Analytics can help all workspace contributors - from page creators to knowledge managers - make information more useful and accessible in Notion.
If you create, maintain or update knowledge in the workspace, you can get helpful insights into how your content is received. So, you can check who’s read the latest version of a feature spec, discover topics of interest within your organization, and identify the Notion champions who are best placed to train other users, and more.
In this guide, we’ll show you where to find analytics data and use it to boost engagement with content and adoption of Notion in general.
----
As a workspace member, you can view page analytics for any page you have editing access to.
To open page analytics, go to the🕘  View all updatesicon at the top right of the page, which will open a sidebar on the right-hand side. Click on theAnalyticstab.
Here, you’ll be able to see:
The total and unique page views— The Views graph will show you how times the page has been viewed and when, plus the number of unique views. If your page is shared to the web, online views will also be counted.
Who viewed the page— Under Viewers, there’ll be a list of people who’ve viewed the page, and when they last viewed it. This list won’t include anonymous viewers who aren’t members or guests, but have seen your page online.
----
Creator and editors of the page (Business and Enterprise Plans only)— See who first created the page, and when, as well as a list of everyone who has subsequently edited the page.
This data is useful if you want to make sure everyone has seen the latest version of a doc. A product manager, for example, might want to check page analytics to ensure that everyone on the team has seen the Product Requirement Doc (PRD) since the latest changes. Similarly, an HR manager might need to check who has read the updated benefits policy and decide whether to send another email reminding people to review it.
----
Page analytics can also give you an overview of how a document or database has evolved over time. You can see who has contributed to the information and when certain changes were made
This not only helps you understand how up-to-date the doc is - it also means you can reach out to whoever last edited the page if you have any questions about the information.
IT managers and those responsible for building and maintaining the company knowledge base need to understand the effectiveness of the Notion workspace and how to make it easier and faster to access knowledge, share information, and connect with colleagues.
Workspace analytics help you do this.
Organizations on Notion’s Enterprise plan can use Workspace analytics.
----
- Content analytics are available to all Members of the workspace for the pages they have edit access to.- Workspace owners also have access to Search and Member analytics.
To open workspace analytics, go to⚙️ Settings & membersin the top left corner. Then, clickAnalytics, which is located under Workspace.
Workspace analytics are organized into three categories:Members,ContentandSearch. You can also view a combination of key data in the Overview tab.
Here are some ways you might use each category of workspace analytics:
----
Understand how well your team members are adopting Notion— In theMemberstab, workspace owners can see which teamspaces each member belongs to, how many pages they’ve viewed over a certain time period, how many edits they’ve made over that time period and the date of their most recent activity. From here, you can spot your power users and identify less active members who might need extra support or training.
----
Track how people engage with content— In theContenttab, workspace members can track engagement with metrics like number of views, unique viewers, and last edited date. With this data you can identify popular pages and outdated content. All your pages will be displayed in a table, along with the teamspace they belong to, the page audience, total views, unique views, total views, and the last edited date. You can filter the table by time period to see, for example, activity over the last 7 days or the current month.
----
See what team members are searching for — Workspace owners can view what members are searching for in theSearchtab. Here, metrics like Number of searches, Number of unique members searching, and click-through rate can help you detect content gaps (for example, if people are searching for a doc that doesn’t exist yet). You can also update and refresh content to ensure it’s meeting the needs of your users and providing sufficient knowledge.
Workspace analytics are a key piece of the puzzle that can tell you how people at your organization are using Notion, and there are various ways to use that information. If you want to do a more in-depth analysis or create charts based on your data, you can export your data as a CSV file.
----
Your most active team members who frequently create and edit pages are likely to be power users who are very comfortable with Notion. These team members could become champions of your workspace best practices, and even provide training to your least active users who need extra support. You can find these power users by looking at theAll memberstable and seeing who is most active.
----
Knowledge managers can use workspace analytics to decide what new content to create, and set priorities for which documents to create update next. In theContenttab, you can sort pages by their popularity to show most-viewed pages first. Then, scroll to right to see the last-edited date. If an often-viewed document hasn’t been edited for a few months, you may want to mark that as priority to review and refresh.

Get organized for a new semester with Notion
Going back to school can feel overwhelming, but Notion is the perfect tool to overcome the challenge and step confidently into your new semester.
Notion can be your home for everything related to school. Take class notes, draft essays, collect resources and references, brainstorm ideas, and keep all your information connected and findable. You can even use AI to extract insights from notes and research and enhance your creative thinking.
With everything organized and connected in Notion, you’ll be able to work faster and stay on top of your studies.
From research and note-taking to planning daily chores and grocery lists, this guide will show you how to manage college life in Notion.
----
Kick off your Notion workspace with ready-made pages from thetemplate gallery.
The Class Notes template is the perfect place to store your notes. Instead of jotting ideas down in various notebooks or having a bunch of disorganized files on your desktop, you can keep all lecture notes in one Notion database and tag each page with key information so they’re easy to find and refer back to later.
To create a new note, click onNew, give your page a title, and start typing your notes. As well as text, you can add all kinds of blocks to Notion pages — headers, bullets, checklists, images, videos, files, and embedded content from other apps. Open the/menu to browse all the different kinds ofNotion blocksavailable.
----
You can categorize pages in your Class Notes database with useful information. These properties allow you to categorize notes with different kinds of information and refer back to them. When you create a new note, it will automatically capture the created date. Then, you can tag the relevant class, type of class, attach any files, and check off when the note has been reviewed. You can click on any of these properties and edit to reflect your classes.
To add a new property, open one of your notes and click+ Add new property. This will open a menu where you can choose from Notion’s range of properties.
Here are some ways you might use properties to categorize your class notes:
----
Give your notes a Status— Use theStatusproperty to mark your note asNot started,In progress, orDone, so you can see whether notes are finished or still need work.
Categorize your notes by topic— Use aSelectorMulti-selectproperty to add topic categories to your notes. This comes in handy later, as you’ll be able to filter your database to show all notes about a certain topic.
See when you last edited your note— TheLast editedproperty shows when you last made changes to a page and can help you understand how up-to-date the content is.
----
Connect notes to a course or project— With aRelationproperty, you can connect one database to another. So you could, for example, connect class notes to a projects database. Then, when you want to work on that project, you’ll find all the relevant notes in one place.
Get an automatic summary of your note— Adding anAI Summaryproperty to your database will generate an automatic summary of the page contents. So, you’ll be able to get an idea of what each note contains with just a glance at the database.
Level up with classes before school starts
Click to expand
Adding properties to your notes means that you will be able to sort and filter the database content based on different criteria.
----
Use theSortfeature to change the order that items appear. If you sort by Created date, notes will appear in chronological order. Sorting by Class or Type will arrange your notes according to those properties.
You can also filter the database to only show a subset of the content according to how properties are completed. So, if you only want to see notes related to one class, click on Filter. Then, in Class, check the class you want — LIT 455, for example. Now, the database will only show notes where you’ve tagged LIT 455 as the relevant class. The rest of the notes remain in the database, and you can turn off the filter anytime.
----
To take this further, you can create new views for different filtered groups of information. So, you could have a separate database view for each class and one for all notes.
To create a new view, click on the + symbol next to views. Select the type of view you want (board, list, table, etc.), and you can then choose how information will appear in that view using filters and sorts.
Here are some helpful ways you could filter and sort your database:
View all unfinished notes— Filter to show all notes where the Status property is not Done.
See all notes about a topic— To view all your class notes about a particular topic, filter to show the topic or topics.
----
Create a “Class by class” view of all notes— Add a new view and sort the database by course. Now, all notes will be grouped together according to the class they relate to.
An important part of your studies is collecting and consuming content, which you’ll need to reference later on when it comes to writing essays and your dissertation.
In Notion, you can save resources from the web straight to a database in one click and enter all the relevant information that will make it easier to reference in your work.
To collect resources or build a reading list in Notion, first create a new database page in Notion - you could call it Resources.
----
Next, download theWeb Clipperextension for your chosen browser. Once you've installed the Web Clipper, you'll see a Notion button appear to the right of your browser search bar.
Anytime you’re on a web page, you can click the icon to save the page Notion. You can select your Resources database as the place to save the content. When you save a web page, text and images from the web will be brought over to the page, so you can read the content in Notion.
You can keep anything from research papers, books, podcasts, articles, and more in your Resources database. Categorize each entry using properties for content type, publication date, author, etc.
As with your Class Notes, you can filter and sort items in your Resources database.
----
Notion AI can be particularly useful for extracting value from resources you save. There are three types of AI autofill properties:Summary,Key Insights, andCustom, and you can add AI blocks into page content as well.
Here are a few ways to use Notion AI to get more out of your resources:
Get the main takeaways from a piece of content— Use theKey Insightsproperty to generate the main takeaways from any resource you’ve saved. This will help you sort through the most valuable articles you’ve saved.
Read a simplified version of the text— You can ask Notion AI to simplify the text to make it easier to digest. Just highlight the text, clickAsk AIand selectSimplify language.
----
Translate or summarize in another language— If you’ve saved an important resource that’s not in your first language, you could ask Notion AI to translate the whole piece or just provide a summary in your language. Either highlight the text and ask AI to translate, or, using a Custom AI property, prompt Notion AI to “Write a summary of this page in Korean”, for example.
Automatically highlight keywords— Again using aCustom AIproperty, this time, you can prompt Notion AI to highlight the key words from a piece of text, or categorize the content in one or two words.
Go further with AI
Notion has a built-in AI assistant that can help you improve your writing, check spelling and grammar, brainstorm ideas and more. Discover Notion AIhere.
----
Relations are Notion properties that allow you to connect databases, so you can create links between information in those databases.
By linking your resources to other Notion databases, you can make sure you have all the necessary materials readily available for your work, and also make the job of adding references to your thesis less confusing.
----
To add aRelationproperty, go to+ Add new propertyin the Properties menu and selectRelation. There, choose the database you want to connect to. You could connect your Resources database to your Class Notes, and this would allow you to link reading material to each note. If you had a database for drafting chapters of your thesis, you could also link this to your Resources databases, so you can attach Resources as you go chapter by chapter.
Instead of painstakingly going back to search for all your references at the end of a project, in Notion, you can attach sources to your drafts as you go, so nothing gets lost or forgotten.
----
Your first experience of living independently can be daunting. You’re suddenly responsible for so many areas of your life — groceries, cooking, cleaning, socializing, extracurriculars, and sticking to your student budget.
Notion is ideal for juggling the demands of college and will help you keep on top of everything you have to do.
Here are some ways to use Notion for everyday life:
Schedule household chores— Sharing a place with fellow students is both exciting and challenging. Avoid potential conflicts over chores by keeping track of everyone’s responsibilities in Notion. Invite your roommates to a shared Notion page and keep a list of chores, either as a simple checklist or a database.
----
Create a homepage for your hobby or extra-curricular group— You can share Notion pages with anyone you like simply by opening theSharemenu and adding their email address, and you can decide the level of access they’re allowed. Createa homepage for your club or extra-curricular groupin Notion, and keep resources, notes, and information for everyone, whether it’s your book club or hockey team.
Keep track of tasks to do— Make yourto-do listin Notion by creating a list or table database with a checkbox property to tick off tasks once they’re done. You can categorize tasks according to whether they relate to school, home, family, etc.
----
Manage your budget—Track your income and expensesin Notion to make sure you don’t go over budget. Tag expenses and income in a table database and review how much you’re spending every month.
Create meal plans and shopping lists— If you’re on a budget, you probably want to avoid constantly ordering takeout. Instead,plan your weekly mealsin Notion and get all the ingredients you need to pick up from the store. Ask Notion AI to suggest different types of recipes (easy, healthy, vegan, etc), then ask for the list of ingredients for each recipe.

Getting started with Notion Calendar
Most calendar apps are standalone tools, disconnected from the places where you actually do your work and store your knowledge.
Notion Calendar is designed to allow you to manage all your commitments alongside where you do work.
You already have tasks, projects, notes, and knowledge in Notion, and now you can add the layer of time.
Instead of having to manually add focus blocks, tasks, and work items from Notion to your Calendar, all you have to do now is connect a database or link a Notion page to an event.
Notion Calendar also syncs with Google Calendar so you can bring your personal and professional calendars into one app and spend less time juggling your commitments.
----
You’ll have full transparency to track your days and weeks without ever missing an important meeting.
In this guide, you’ll learn how to get started with Notion Calendar and some valuable tips and tricks.
It will only take five simple steps to get started with Notion Calendar.
Download the desktop app— Notion Calendar is separate from the Notion app, so you’ll need to download the Notion Calendar app for Mac or Windows.
Enable event notifications— When you enable notifications, you’ll get helpful reminders for upcoming events, including a countdown timer in your desktop menu bar.
----
Connect calendar accounts— When you connect all your Google accounts, all events from these calendars will appear in your Notion Calendar. You can hide calendars as needed.
Link your Notion workspace— Follow the steps to link Notion Calendar to your workspace.
Add Notion databases— With workspaces connected, you can start to add Notion databases to your calendar. Events will appear in your calendar for items in connected databases which have a time and date.
Currently, you might be managing  your commitments in a separate calendar app where you need several calendars. If you already use Notion for task management and knowledge, Notion Calendar is a seamless way to connect your events with contextual information.
----
Once you have all your calendars and databases connected, you can schedule meetings, add events that are connected to your Notion databases, and link Notion pages to events to make the most of your time.
To get started with Notion Calendar, simply download and install the app, sign in with Google, and you’re done!

Getting started with projects and tasks
In Notion, project and task management lives alongside your docs, notes and company knowledge. Instead of switching between tools, losing focus and efficiency, team members will find everything they need to get work done in one place.
Leaders can oversee their team’s progress, and different departments can collaborate with clarity - from the high-level goals that drive each objective to granular tasks that move projects forward.
Starting with a projects & tasks template that’s ready to go, you can create a fully customized system that suits the way you work best. In this guide, we’ll show you what’s possible with task and project management in Notion.
Go straight to the templates
----
Check out our in-app template pickerhere.
There are few things more important than managing your team’s projects and tasks. After all, you need an efficient system to get things done, and track what gets done.
But you don’t want your employees relying on memory to know what tasks they have to do. You need a reliable system that all employees trust and use, where nothing slips through the cracks, gets missed or forgotten.
Plus, leaders need a high-level view of what’s going on so they know how much work each team member has on their plate and how close projects are to completion.
----
With Notion’s Projects & Tasks databases, project management is straightforward and intuitive. You can manage everything you and your team need to do without wasting time navigating an overly complex system or jumping back and forth between tools. Connecting all aspects of the work, from meeting notes to documents, means everyone has access to relevant information and context.
The Projects and tasks template is only available in the Notion app, so to start a project tracking system from the template, go toTemplatesin the sidebar.
Your system can’t be too clunky or process-heavy, and should facilitate getting on with what matters (the work), not slow down the team with too much admin.
----
There are three built-in project management templates in Notion, each with a designated use case in mind. Regardless of which one you start with, you’ll be able to customize it by adding more properties later on.
To-do list— This is a single database for simple task management where you can create, organize, and track your tasks. It’s best used for one-off projects or individual task management where you want to keep your system as minimal as possible.
Projects & tasks —Ideal for team project management, these databases allow you to organize tasks by project and track progress across your team. Projects and tasks are two separate but related databases. You can record different information in each database and link them with one another.
----
Projects, tasks & sprints— Selecting this template adds another layer to your projects and tasks, allowing you to arrange tasks into time-boxed sprints, ideal for project and issue tracking for engineering teams.
Large projects become more manageable as you break them down into smaller chunks and assign tasks to different team members. Having your tasks and projects connected means every task can form part of a larger objective, and you’ll see your projects move forward with every completed task.
When you add new tasks or projects to the database, you can outline task details and scope projects directly in the database page. This means pertinent information related to each task and project is always within everyone’s reach.
----
Here are some things to know about how tasks and projects relate to each other:
Projects are the parent of tasks —One project can have many tasks, but each task should only relate to a single project. You can think of tasks as stepping stones towards completing a project.
Projects have project properties —Your projects have properties like status, people, related tasks, and related task completion percent.
Tasks have task properties —Tasks have properties for the assignee, due date and status.
Project progress is measured by completed tasks— The completion property calculates the number of completed tasks per project and displays the percentage as a progress bar.
----
Tasks can also relate to sprints— If you are using Tasks, Projects & Sprints, you’ll have a relation between tasks and sprints. This means you can add tasks to do to your current sprint, giving everyone a clear set of objectives for the sprint.
When you add Projects & Tasks to a teamspace, everyone in the teamspace has access to those databases. This means that the whole team has visibility into what they need to do, and can take an active role in logging their progress in the database.
Read our fullpermissions guideto see how permissions work in teamspaces.
----
Notion gives you the flexibility to visualize the same information set in different ways. You can create contextual views to focus on whatever matters in the moment, whether it be a view of one person’s assigned tasks, tasks grouped by their parent project, or everything due in the next 7 days.
The projects database should be your home for general management since all tasks should relate to a parent project.
You can use task views when you want to dive into your day-to-day work.
The projects database comes with views that allow you to:
See active projects in a kanban board view —The “Active” view hides all projects that aren’t marked as “Planning” or “In progress” to focus on and manage active projects.
----
View only your projects  —“Mine” view filters the database to show projects that you’re tagged in dynamically. Selecting “Me” rather than your name means this filter will apply to whoever is logged in and viewing the database at the time.
Get an overview of all projects —The “All” table layout shows everything in the database. This view is useful for making bulk changes or getting a sense of all properties related to multiple projects.
Assess workload with “Timeline” view —Here, you’ll see your projects arranged according to start and end date. By seeing how commitments overlap, you can make sure the workload is balanced and judge your team’s capacity for new projects.
In the tasks database, you’ll have views where you can:
----
See tasks grouped by their parent project —The “By project” view splits your task list by related project.
View all tasks assigned to you  —In “Mine”, the database is filtered to show only tasks assigned to “Me” (just like in the projects database, this is a dynamic property depending on who is logged in and viewing the database.)
Arrange tasks by assignee— The “People” view is ideal for giving managers a view of each team member’s to-do list.
In both databases, you can create any new views that you and your team would find helpful.
To add a new property to the database click on options…,Properties, and+ New property.
----
You’ll see that the Projects & Tasks template has some suggested properties designed specifically forproject management.so/product/projects. Here are some ways to use these properties:
Assign a priority score to projects and tasks— Using the priority property, you can create different priority scores (Low, Medium, High, or P0, P1, P2) and then sort items by their importance.
Tag different types of tasks— Using the Task type property, you can create tags for different kinds of tasks. You could even create a view based off of these tags, handy for task batching.
Give projects a description— Add a text property to your projects database where you can write a short description of the project. This is easy for everyone to view at a glance.
----
Assign a reporter to a task or project —If you’re using these databases for issue reporting and fixing, the reporter is a “Created by” property which will record the person who first noticed the bug.
Using any of Notion’s property types, you can build your own properties specific to your team’s needs.
For example:
Create a relation to GitHub task board— You can create synced databases to pull GitHub tasks into Notion. If you relate this synced database to your task board, you can pull through tasks from GitHub into your tasks database.
----
Build a RICE impact formula for project prioritization— Use 4 separate properties: Reach (number), Impact (high, medium, low), Confidence (percentage) and Effort (number). Then you can create a formula in Notion to calculate a project’s score according to the RICE framework. We have a step-by-step guide on how to do this
here.
Let coworkers or the public upvote tasks— Using a formula, you can create an
upvote propertyin your Tasks database and let your team members vote to decide on the priority of tasks.
You have several options for how to view the information in databases. You can change the database layout by going to the options menu…andLayout.
----
Choose from table, board, timeline, calendar, list or gallery layouts. Within one database, you can create multiple views, each with a different type of layout.
So, your projects database might have a table, a board and a timeline, while your tasks database could contain a list, a board and a table.
Each of these layouts can then be filtered and sorted in different ways to create shortcuts to view a sub-section of the information in the database.

Getting started with templates for your team
Notion templates will help you jump-start page creation, and inspire you to create your own Notion workflows.
Add a template to your workspace via theTemplatesbutton in the sidebar, or when creating a new page.
We specifically recommend using our database-powered templates: To-do list, Projects & tasks, Meetings, and Docs.
Remember that database entries are fully functional Notion pages, capable of hosting all content types, as well as other Notion pages.
Databases boast properties, which are pieces of information about each database entry. They can be of various types like text, numbers, dates, or people.
----
Relation propertiesallow entries from one database to be linked to entries from another database. TheProjects & taskstemplates use relation properties to link tasks to their associated projects.
TheProjectstemplate has a completion property, which calculates the percentage of tasks marked asDone.

Give your to-dos a Home with Task databases
With Notion, you can track everything you have to do, and link individual tasks with projects in a connected system for managing your work.
But, what happens when tasks are assigned to you from several different sources? Things get confusing if you have to constantly check multiple places to keep up with your tasks.
Now, you have a dedicated Notion Home that’s tailor-made for you. Along with links to recently opened docs, suggested pages, and trending topics, you’ll find My tasks, a convenient place that groups together all tasks assigned to you, from any database in the workspace.
----
In this guide, we’ll show you how you can stay organized and up to date with everything that’s on your plate using My Tasks.
When it’s time to power through your to-do list, the last thing you want is to waste time searching for tasks and relevant information. My tasks automatically brings all your assigned tasks into one manageable to-do list that’s built into Home.
Tasks will show up in Home when they are assigned to you in a Task type database. If you’ve used Notion’s Projects & tasks databases previously, you may already have these.
If not, follow the steps below to convert any of your task trackers into a Task database.
Go to the database.
Open the Settings…menu.
ClickTurn into task database.
----
Task databases must have aStatusproperty, anAssigneeproperty, and aDue date, so add these properties if they aren’t there already.
Now, when you navigate back to Home, you’ll see any tasks assigned to you from the Task database appear there.
If you’re working on different teams and projects, colleagues might make requests or assign tasks to you from different places. For example, copywriters might get assigned tasks across several distinct campaigns, and engineers may have to triage requests from several different teams.
As long as those databases are turned into tasks databases, all tasks will show up in your Home where you can sort and filter through them according to your priorities.
----
You can also open My tasks as a page, and add it your favorites for easy access from your sidebar.
Because the My tasks widget is synced in real time to all Task databases, you’ll know right away when a new task is assigned to you or if the status of a task changes.
In your My tasks widget, you can:
See all tasks assigned to you— Any items that have been assigned to you from any tasks database across the workspace will appear in the My tasks widget.
Open tasks to see more context— Click on a task to open it as a page and read more information or add comments.
Customize the database view— In the full page view of My tasks, select different layouts to view your tasks in a kanban board, gallery, timeline, calendar or list.
----
Update properties instantly— View and seamlessly update properties from within the My tasks widget, so you can mark a task as complete or assign it to someone else without navigating to the original database.
Filter and sort the tasks that appear— By default, only tasks assigned to you that are not marked as completed will appear. You can customize these filters and add new ones, for example, if you only want to see tasks due in the next week or month.
Check on tasks for your team— In addition to viewing tasks assigned to you, you can adjust the filter to look at tasks assigned to anyone in your workspace, like, for example, all the tasks for your team.
----
Add new tasks directly— Select+to add a new task. Some properties will automatically be filled in according to your database settings.
My tasks is just one widget in your Notion Home, a collection of resources adapted to you that serves as a launchpad to help you dive into your next task, catch up with what your colleagues are reading, or even brush up on your Notion skills.
Home gives you somewhere to start and a place you can always return to with one click. Here, you’ll find the pages that are most relevant to you, so you can jump straight into productive work.
In addition to My tasks, Home also contains other widgets of useful information.
Jump back into recent pages— TheRecently visitedwidget contains links to pages you last viewed.
----
Personalized reading suggestions— TheSuggested for youwidget contains pages that may interest you, based on your recent activity in the workspace.
Check out trending topics— See what pages are currently popular in your workspace. In theTrendingtab, you can view popular topics from the whole company, and also filter to view popular pages by teamspace.
Get inspired by featured templates— Browse the collection ofFeatured templatesthat can help you work more efficiently.
Boost your Notion skills— In theLearnwidget, you can develop your Notion skills. Each recommendation is a link to a useful guide from the Notion Help Center.
----
Home unites all your work and relevant information, so it’s easy to stay connected with your colleagues and focus on what needs your attention.
Customize the page by opening the settings menu…at the top right. Here, decide which widgets to show or hide or change the default page to theLast visited pageor the first page in your sidebar.

Grant the right level of access with teamspaces and groups
You need an easy way to empower the people on your team, and in fact the whole company, to access the information they need for their work without always having to request it.
For example, engineers might need the ability to edit a feature spec, while marketing only needs to view and comment on that page. And there’s probably only a small group of people you want editing, say, your benefits information. But you want everyone else to be able to read it.
----
Sometimes, sharing a single page with someone is the best approach. But if individuals are constantly requesting access to this document, and that database, it can quickly spin out of control. You need a simple way to provision access to groups of people at once, according to their role, team, and level at the company.
Teamspaces and groups work together in Notion so you can do just that. You’ll store and organize information in teamspace, share content through teamspace permissions, and layer access levels through groups.
----
In this guide, we’ll explain how to use teamspaces and groups to give everyone access to the information they need. At the same time, you’ll ensure sensitive and important information isn’t at risk of being changed, deleted, or shared by mistake.
With custom groups, you can quickly share content with lots of people at the same time, and add whole groups of people to a teamspace at once.
Groups can help streamline management of page permissions and teamspace members, meaning instead of creating an Engineering teamspace and adding all the engineering team members one by one, if you’ve already set up an Engineering group, you can add the whole group with one click.
----
Plus, whenever a new engineer joins the team, you only have to add them to the engineers group and they’ll automatically be part of all the same teamspaces as the rest of the group.
You can also add members and provision access to groups and teamspaces in Notion with SCIM, if your company uses it.
To manage groups, go “Settings & members” in the sidebar, and click on the “Groups” tab.
Here you can:
Review existing groups— See all the groups as well as the teamspaces they belong to and the number of members.
Add or remove people from groups— Click on the dropdown to the left of the group name to view all members of the group. You can “Remove” people from the group, or click “+ Add members” to add new people to the group.
----
Make new teamspaces from groups— Create a teamspace from a group simply by going to the options menu “…” next to the group and selecting “Create teamspace from group”.  You can edit the name, icon and description of the group, and all members of the group will automatically be part of the teamspace, though you can add more individuals or groups later.
If your Notion workspace was your whole office building, teamspaces would be a bit like the different floors or areas housing each department. You’ll likely have teamspaces for engineering, sales, marketing, finance etc - as well as for cross-functional projects, physical office locations, affinity groups and more.
----
As a teamspace owner, you have control over how both teamspace members and non-members can view information inside the teamspace.
You can customize access to teamspace content by clicking on the options menu (…) next to the teamspace name, and selecting “Teamspace settings”.
As a teamspace owner, you can decide who can view, edit, and share content. Open, closed, and private teams dictate how a workspace member can join a teamspace, while permission levels determine how they interact with content.
Choose whether to make the teamspace Open, Closed or Private— Anyone can view content and join Open teamspaces. Everyone can see Closed teamspaces, but can’t join unless you invite them.  Private teamspaces are only visible to members.
----
Customize access levels for teamspace owners, members, and everyone else —In an Open teamspace, you can choose which permission level to give people who aren’t members of the teamspace: either Can Edit, Can Comment, or Can View. In Closed teamspaces, you can change the permission levels for members, and you also have the option to restrict access for everyone who isn’t a teamspace member.
Decide who can invite members to the teamspace and edit the sidebar— You can allow everyone to edit the sidebar, or make it so that only teamspace owners can. In Closed and Private teams, select whether all members, or only owners, can invite others to the teamspace.
----
Add individual people or groups to the teamspace— Type their name and click “+ Add”. As well as individuals, you can also add whole groups.
Set custom permissions for groups (Enterprise plans only) —You can give additional access to a subset of teamspace members. When you’ve added a group to the teamspace, go to the dropdown next to the group’s name, and select “Custom permissions.” You can’t give less access than the teamspace default - only more. So, if the teamspace default is “Can Edit”, you can assign “Full access” to a particular group.
Edit member status— Change members to owners (and vice versa), or remove people altogether from the teamspace, by opening the dropdown next to individual or group name.
----
Choose whether to give people the option to share pages to the web— You could create a single teamspace for all publicly shared pages. By consolidating all public pages in one teamspace, you keep control over what’s going out of your company’s workspace.
Remove guests from sensitive teamspaces— Some things are too sensitive to be shared externally. You can globally prevent members from adding guests to important teamspaces, like financial analyses, or HR reporting.
Prevent certain pages from being exported— You can disable exporting pages as Markdown, CSV, or PDF files, so you can avoid confidential information being copied outside of the workspace.
----
You can configure the security settings of your teamspace to ensure that your information stays restricted in the way you intent, without preventing your employees from accessing content they need.
As well as adjusting overall teamspace settings, you can change permissions at the individual page level. By default, pages in a teamspace will inherit the same permission settings as the teamspace as a whole. However, you can customize permissions for each page, so you have the power to decide who can view, make changes, leave comments, or share pages with others.
----
To see who has what level of access to a page, open the “Share” menu at the top right corner. Here, you’ll see a list of the groups and individuals with access, and what level of access they have.
There are 5 different levels of access available:
Full access— you can edit the page and share it with others.
Can edit— you can edit the page, but not share it.
Can comment— you can’t edit the page, but can view it and leave comments.
Can view— you can view the page but not leave comments, share or edit.
No access— the page is hidden from you and it will not appear in search.
----
For database pages only, there’s an additionalCan edit contentoption. This means you can edit a page inside a database, including filling out property values, but you won’t be able to change the structure, views, filters, sorts, or properties of the database.
If you share a page with someone who isn’t a member of the Teamspace it belongs in, they’ll see it in their shared menu, and the same is true when you share a private page.
When permissions levels and teamspaces interact, individuals will always retain the most permissive access levels. So, if you’re part of two teamspaces - “Marketing Team” and “Managers”, wherever “Marketing Team” has read only access, but “Managers” can comment, you’ll have permission to comment.
----
To give another example, you’ll always have at least one teamspace which includes everyone, by default. In this “General” teamspace, you could set the default permissions to read only, but, using groups, assign “Full Access” to the People team for certain pages, such as the benefits information.

Grow with quality using these systems to track applicants and onboard new hires
Setting up systems for tracking applicants and onboarding new employees is the most high-leverage thing HR professionals can do for their company. You're on the front lines of growth and setting up new employees for success — challenges that pay longterm dividends once you're able to juggle all the balls associated with these processes.
----
Here, we'll show you step-by-step how to build the foundation for two systems in Notion that are tailored specifically to human resources and people ops teams: one for tracking applicants, one for onboarding. We've seen them have incredible impact for teams who are able to find the right talent and give them the tools they need to flourish.
To create two databases — one for applicant tracking and one for onboarding that systemize your processes for scale.
To organize and customize these databases to meet your team's needs.
Best practices from the Notion People Ops team for more effective hiring and onboarding.
Pretty soon, you'll have two systems that look like this:
Do you have them? Can they be better?
----
People are your company's heartbeat. But you're the eyes.You need a system that sees where applicants are coming from and charts the course for how employees move forward once they're part of your company. Setting up these processes can be difficult, especially with the unique set of problems HR teams face when it comes to hiring and onboarding:
Information overload during hiring— materials, notes and data about candidates come from everywhere throughout the hiring process, from phone screens to onsite interviews to sample work and resumes. Not having a system means you might miss vital info you need to make an important team decision.
----
There's no onboarding process at all— without a system, important docs and tribal knowledge aren't passed to new employees. There's no way to know which new employee has completed what, and what they still need to do.
New hires don't feel like part of the team— this is especially true for remote teams. Avatars from online profiles don't have much life. Plus, there's no good way to share your company culture or best practices with new employees digitally.
In Notion, you can create custom processes for hiring and onboarding, and keep all information about candidates and documents centralized in one place.
----
One system for everything you need— resumes, portfolios, references, test projects and everything related to a candidate or employee are packaged in one place. Pages inside your project tracker hold all the information you and your team need to make decisions.
Every aspect is totally customizable— mold Notion to how you work, like setting your interview schedules or onboarding steps. And as your company grows and processes change, all these aspects can be easily updated.
Company-wide transparency— with centralized hiring and onboarding info, anyone at the company can quickly access it. Checking on the status of a referral or seeing where the new engineer is at in their onboarding makes the entire organization part of the process.
----
Someone's journey with your company starts the moment they consider applying. With Notion, you can create a branded, consistent, high-quality experience all the way from application to onboarding, setting the foundation for your growth by establishing a solid process.
Your applicant tracker and new hire onboarding systems are two different databases built on the same foundation. The applicant tracker will help you move potential hires through your recruiting process. Similarly, the onboarding system will help you set a process where new hires get oriented with all the appropriate materials.
----
With them, you'll be able to seamlessly move people from applicant to onboarded teammate, tracking every step in both processes. Here's how to build them yourself.
You can make many different kinds of databases in Notion: a table, calendar, list, board and more. Here, we'll be making a board — a collection of individual pages you can move from one stage to the next.
Type/and you'll see a list of things you can include in a Notion page. This is called the "slash command." You can use it to do just about anything in Notion.
Add a new page and then selectBoardfrom the templates you see listed.
----
At the top of the board are columns. These will act as stages in your process, which you can customize however's best for you. In your Applicant Tracker, they'll be stages like "Lead," "Interview," etc. In your New Hire Onboarding, they'll go from "Not Started" to "Complete."
We've included a few blank cards in your board. Each will eventually be cards for your candidates or new hires where all their information will live. Inside each card are properties — different attributes that describe a candidate or employee. Create any number of different properties you'd like. Click+ Add a propertyto make your own.
----
Click on a property and underPROPERTY TYPE, you'll see a menu for the types of properties you can include. Use aSelectproperty to assign a lead source, like "Inbound" or "Referral." Try aPersonproperty to tag the hiring manager. There's even anEmailproperty for contact info.
You can add or remove properties easily, and when changing the properties, you only need to do it once. Edits will be reflected when you make a new page.
Based on anySelect,Multi-selectorPersonproperty, you can change the columns in your board. Maybe you want to see status of new hire onboarding. Or maybe you want to see how many referrals are in the pipeline. To change the columns on your board, hitGroup byon the top right.
----
Boards in Notion pull double duty — they track process while keeping all relevant information neatly bundled together.This'll save you time assembling disparate notes and sources of information about and for applicants and new hires alike, while allowing everyone on your team to contribute to the process.
A company's hiring and onboarding processes are as unique as fingerprints. Notion is like a set of building blocks you can use to create the perfect system for your needs.
----
Show properties in your board view— to understand what's going on with your candidates and new hires at a glance, you can display them right on the cards in your board. Instead of needing to click into a card to see an applicant's location or the hiring manager, you can see all that info right from the board view. On the top right of your board, click•••and hitProperties. Toggle the ones you want to display. You can even rearrange them using the⋮⋮icon.
----
Change views for whatever you need to see— with Notion, you can serve the same dataset many different ways. You can have a list of all the new hires you made this year. You can have a calendar of when they started. You can even set up views just for different teams, both for hiring and onboarding.
To do it, click+ Add a viewnear your board's title. Then select the type of database you want, give it a name and hitCreate. Next, you're going to apply different filters to surface only the information you want to see in this specific view.
----
HitFilter, then+ Add a filter. These are all related to the properties in your cards. For example, maybe you only want to see which hiring managers closed roles and when. You can filter to just see those, then hitSortand+ Add a sortto organize by start date.
Here’s a 4-minute video teaching you everything you need to know about using advanced database filters.
With custom views, Notion is like another member of your team, giving you only the information you need when you need it. Even teams or hiring managers can create views they need. This helps package what was once a large dataset into more manageable (and relevant) pieces.
More properties & views for your Applicant Tracker
----
Properties will help organize and prioritize all the applicants in the pipeline. Here are a few that might help:
The role they're filling— aSelectproperty where you can designate what team this person will be joining, from product to customer support.
Their contact— anEmailorPhoneproperty so you don't have to dig through your inbox to quickly and easily touch base with them.
Website— aWebsiteproperty for their personal website, so anyone on the team can review samples, design work and anything else.
Skills— aMulti-selectproperty where you can create any number of tags based on their skills, like "Front End" or "UX" for an engineer.
----
Source of the application— whether it's a referral, a cold inbound or a warm intro, you can use aSelectproperty to track where you're getting the most leads.
With such an ocean of applicants, custom views act like a net so you're surfacing only what's relevant right here and now. Try these:
By team— a table view of candidates by team, like engineering or marketing.
By hiring manager— a board view where each column is a different hiring manager, and all the roles they're responsible for are pages filed underneath.
By source— with many applicants in the pipe, it can be beneficial to see where they're coming from. This board view, where columns are organized by source, helps with that.
----
A calendar of start dates— a calendar view so you can see when candidates are starting.
More properties & views for your New Hire Onboarding
Properties help create visibility into the onboarding process, both for new hires and for teammates responsible for certain steps in the process. Here are a few we like:
Their department— aSelectproperty where you'll include the department this new team member is joining.
Start date— with aDateproperty, you can assign a start date for new employees. This helps with scheduling check-ins down the road, like at 90 days or one year.
Putting a face to the name— with aFiles & mediaproperty, you can include a photo of your new hire so existing team members can get to know them more personally.
----
Fun facts— aTextproperty where the new employee can include a fun fact about themselves, like if they think a hotdog is a sandwich or not.
Views are important so you can see where everyone's at in the onboarding process, no matter what department they're part of or when they started. These might be helpful:
By team— a board where the columns are different departments and new hires are slotted in each one. You can also create custom views for each team to see only additions to that team.
By start date— a table of all teammates, organized with the newest start date at the top.
By onboarding status— a board where columns are different statuses, so you can see where each new employee is in the onboarding funnel, and what's left to do.
----
In Notion, customization is like an onion. It can be high-level, like changing columns in a board to match your onboarding process. Or it can be granular, where the pages nested in these columns are personalized to every candidate.
For instance, you might want to create a page for an engineering onsite interview, with information about the day's structure. Or you can share specific tools used by the engineering team in an onboarding page. These allow you to develop a completely custom experience for every potential or existing employee — that kind of thing doesn't go unnoticed.
----
Headers— to give each page a clean and tidy look, consider adding different sized headers to organize your information. Choose fromH1(the largest),H2orH3. When prepping your hiring manager for an interview with an engineering candidate, you can include anH1header for "Prep" withH2headers underneath for "Background Info" and "Skills Criteria." This makes downloading information much easier for someone pitching in on an interview.
----
Drag-and-drop— using the⋮⋮icon, move anything around your pages. Pages inside pages, text, images, just about anything can be organized however you'd like. You can even grab headers and drag them all the way to the right (the blue guides will help) to create columns. That way, you can have "Interview Questions" on a left column and "Call Notes" on the right for easy reference.
You can take customization even further with Notion's embeds. These open up a world of possibilities for what can be included in a page. Here's what might be useful to your team:

For applicant tracking
----
Whether it's internal pages so your team can review an application, or an external page you're sharing with a candidate, certain embeds help unite all relevant pieces of information. To access these embeds, simply type/and its name. For example/imageor/map.
Sample work— instead of needing to leave your Applicant Tracker to review materials, Notion brings them all together. For designers, embed prototypes from Figma, Invision, Miro and more. For engineers, you can work together in code blocks, or embed GitHub gists.
PDFs & other files— resumes for internal reviewers, style guides if the applicant is working on a project, etc. Just type/embedand paste the share link to embed from 500+ apps.
----
Maps— when hosting an onsite interview, you can embed the location of your office from Google Maps right inside the applicant's custom prep page they receive in advance.

For new hire onboarding
Every team has unique onboarding needs. When bringing on a new teammate, you can customize the experience based on which team they're joining. To include these embeds, type/todo,/linkand/web.
A to-do list so you know what's complete— few things are as satisfying as checking something off a to-do list. You can include a list in a new hire's onboarding materials so they know what they need to complete (and you get transparency into what they've done so far).
----
Link to internal pages— whether it's a company wiki, a lunch-ordering system, or any other materials you already have that this new hire will need, you can link to them inside their onboarding page for quick reference.
Web bookmarks for external pages— things like benefits information, vacation and expense policies, etc. usually live across many websites. These can all be included in onboarding pages by linking to external websites or even embedding PDFs right inside the page.
----
From an applicant tracking perspective, templates help your team operate off the same set of principles, questions, and assessments. For onboarding, templates can speed up your process so you're not reinventing the wheel every time that, say, a new marketer or designer joins.
By setting the framework, you're creating a consistent experience. Yes, that's essential for streamlining the growth your team. But it's also essential for doing so with quality, equity, and care — especially as your cadence hits warp-speed.
To create a template in either of your databases, click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton. Then select+ New template. A blank page will come up. This is your template that you can format and then use any time you want.
----
Templates for your Applicant Tracker
New candidate interview— under anH2header for "Notes," you can include several toggles for feedback from different interviewers. On any blank line, type>and a toggle will come up. Title each based on your review system, and inside, interviewers can leave their notes. This keeps all candidate notes reference-able without being overwhelming or immediately viewable. Under these, you can even includeH2headers for "References" and "Next Steps."
----
Interview rubric— inside your interview pages, you can also include a rubric so everyone on your team is evaluating every candidate the same way. Type/tableand chooseTable - Inline. Here you can make the first column all the different things you'll grade a candidate on, from "Skills assessment" to "Culture fit." Make the second column aNumberproperty type, where you can assign a 1 - 5 based on each criteria. Then, turn the third column into aTextproperty where you can leave some notes to expand on your ratings.
----
Assigning team-specific projects— as your team grows, you'll probably be assigning many projects to candidates. You can create some team-specific templates, like a coding exercise for engineers or a writing assignment for copywriters. Then provide the hiring team with some prompts for analyzing these assignments. Under anH2header for "Notes," tag the reviewers using the@symbol and add a few bullets about what they should be looking for when going through test work.
Templates for your New Hire Onboarding
----
Team-specific materials— along with a custom welcome note, you can include all the materials new teammates will need to start their journey with your company. Make one for each of your teams.H2headers can include "Basics," "HR & Benefits," and "Tools" (which should be specific to the team). It's also nice to include checkboxes under each of these so you know when they've been set up. To make them, type[]on any blank line.
----
30-day check-in— it's important to touch base with new employees, answer questions and make sure they're getting early feedback from their managers. In their onboarding doc, you can create a new page titled "30-Day Check-In." Inside this page, use the@symbol and type@remind aug25. This will remind you to set up the check-in (you'll get a notification). Also inside the page, you can createH2sections where managers, teammates and the employee themselves can provide feedback for total transparency.
----
Our internal applicant tracking and onboarding systems set the foundation for experiences that potential and existing employees have with our company. They’re tools integral to our ability to scale — they help us connect with people and help the people at Notion connect with each other.
There are so many pieces needed to hire and onboard efficiently. These systems put that puzzle together for us. Here are our favorites:
----
Create a company directory— a directory of all employees helps us get to know each other a little better, which is especially important in the era of remote work. It's a database with table and gallery views (see image above) that includes our Notion illustrated portraits, personal websites and emails, the teams we're on, and even things like office pets. Using aFormulaproperty, we even show everyone's tenure in months and years. The table is sorted from newest employee to earliest.
----
Inside these employee pages are what we call "Life Stories." Each week, someone new makes a presentation about their life — it's one of our most valued cultural touchstones keeping us all bonded. These are all saved so new employees can go through and learn more about their coworkers (andsee a number of baby photosalong the way 😉).
----
A new hire newsletter— as with any rapidly-growing team, it can be difficult to stay updated on all the new faces. To help with this, our recruiters put out a new hire newsletter with updates on who's joined, which roles are open, and any other important HR info. We use a gallery database (which you can make by typing/gallery) to show employees' photos to everyone on the team. In theSharemenu on the top right of the page, we useCopy linkto circulate this newsletter via Slack to the entire company.
----
Make a job board— of course we post jobs at Notion using a job board ... in Notion. You can use thisjob board templateto get started, which will include open positions and give applicants a sense of what life is like at your company. It's a series of list databases, one for each team, where pages contain job descriptions and instructions to apply. Using this is a quick way to spin up an instantly editable jobs site without the pains of web development.

Grow your startup: A Notion guide to applicant tracking systems
Notion can be your ideal hiring companion. Use it to draft job descriptions, share new openings on the web, and gather feedback about a potential hire.
Create a board database in Notion to track applicants as they progress through interview stages.
Each applicant's information will be stored in cards, which are individual database entries.
Add custom properties, which are pieces of information about each database entry, to make better sense of your data. In this case, these could be the applicant's hiring manager, role, team, location, skills, website, email, and start date.
Add templates to your database to standardize your interview process.
----
Create different views to group your applicants in various ways, such as by hiring manager or by source.
Consider adding a calendar view to showcase successful candidates' start dates, or a table view for each team.
A perfectly tailored applicant tracking system will help you collaborate closely with teammates to scan the candidate pool, and easily iterate any process changes along the way.

Notion for creative agencies: managing internal and client work
Running an agency can feel like spinning many plates at once. Of course, there’s the day-to-day of your business, like meetings and onboarding new hires. But there’s also the clients and their many projects, each with specific goals, workflows, and requirements.
Your team needs to be able to work in harmony to meet competing deadlines and deliver outstanding work. Without a clear system for organization, teammates waste time looking for information — instead of focusing on the creative work they do best.
----
Notion gives your team a central hub to organize all your internal and client-facing work, from team processes to project specs for clients. And when it’s all in one place, collaboration is seamless, both for the teammates executing projects and the clients reviewing the work.
We’ll show you how to set up a workspace that unites everyone at your agency and brings clients into the loop as projects progress.
Notion’s sidebarhelps you map out your workspace. Top-level pages appear in the sidebar, and you can click on the dropdown next to the page to see sub-pages, and quickly navigate to them. You can create a new top-level page by clicking the+icon.
----
You’ll want to create one top-level page for all your agency’s information so everyone can access things like your employee directory, who’s on which accounts, and benefits info. Each of these can be sub-pages inside your agency's wiki, making it easy to navigate for your team.
In addition to your company-level wiki, each team or department at your agency can create their own wiki. This houses all their specific work — your sales team might have a CRM, your engineering team might have their QA process, marketing might have brand guidelines. Pages are customizable, so they can be molded to the needs of each team.
Similarly, you can create top-level pages for every client, which act as the client's wiki.
----
Everything related to the client will be nested within this page, and you have the freedom to structure it in any way that makes sense. Whether it’s their daily point of contact, communication protocols, or goals — think of this as the homepage between agency and client. It should have everything both teams need to succeed together.
You can invite clients into their area of the workspace, giving them access to the client homepage and all its sub-pages.
It’s important to make sure that people have access to the right pages. For example, everyone at your agency should have access to your agency’s wiki, but clients should only be able to see their pages.
----
Sharing pages inNotion brings everyone together in the right place, so both clients and team members can stay up to date with what’s going on.
To share pages with your client, go to theSharemenu and type their email address into the text field, then clickAdd people. There are different permission levels possible. You’ll probably want to give your clients permission to view and leave comments, but not make changes to the page content itself.
Another way to invite your client is to copy the page link, and share that with your client via email or Slack. If you want to know more about sharing, we have a guide explaining themany ways to share pages in Notion.
----
Now that you have a dedicated space for every client, you can start planning and tracking your projects. Inside your client’s wiki, create a project database to manage all the work you’ll do together.
To create a database, hit the/command and chooseBoard - Full page. This Kanban board will display projects as cards which you can organize by status. This will become one of the sub-pages within your client’s wiki.
Next, you’ll want to add some properties to the database so you can start organizing work. To add a property, selectPropertiesat the top of your database and clickAdd a property. These are some properties you could add to your client’s project database to keep communication smooth and work on track:
----
Status— a status property will help you see what stage each project is at. Use aSelectproperty, and create options such as “Up next,” “In progress,” “Ready for review,” and “Delivered.” You can drag-and-drop the pages depending on where the work sits, making it easy for internal teams and clients to know what they need to do.
Deadlines— add aDateproperty so you can give your project a deadline. If you like, you can toggle onEnd dateto set a timeline for the work that spans days, weeks, or months.
----
Project owner— aPersonproperty means you can tag a teammate to assign them a project. You can rename it “Project owner.” That way you can tag whoever is responsible for completing the project and everyone else knows who they can bring questions to. Add another person property to tag others involved in the project, such as reviewers, or the client.
Type of project— use aSelectproperty and create some tags so that you can identify different types of projects. This can help you prioritize and differentiate between shorter tasks, like tweaking a logo, and longer, more labor-intensive projects like a complete branding or website redesign.
----
In Notion, you can choose from a variety of database types — tables, lists, calendars, timelines, and galleries all have their advantages.The same database can even have multiple views, so you can sort information in different ways.
This means you can have a board view of all your projects, and switch to calendar view to see when those projects are launching. You can surface relevant information in a flash, depending what you need to see, which is especially helpful in the fast-paced world of agency life.
----
As an agency, you’ve likely discovered processes for how to best work with your clients. Whether it’s a stellar creative brief or a new client proposal that considers all the edge cases, database templates can help you cement your processes so everyone executes according to plan, even as your team grows.
To add a database template, go to the dropdown next toNewin the database. Click+ New template. A blank page will open up, and you can edit this, adding prompts or headings to help you quickly jump into a new project.
We have a template for creative briefs which you can findhere.
----
You can make a number of database templates depending on the recurring work you do with a client. From that creative brief, to a launch, to a press release, templates help you approach projects with a set of criteria you've already established — teammates don't need to start from scratch every time.
And when you learn something new about a process or a better way of doing things? Just update the template and those learnings will go forward with you.
Your project database helps you manage work, but it can also be where you actually do the work.
----
Because Notion unites everything in one place, your team will spend less time context switching, hunting down documents, or trying to locate files in email chains. This is valuable for agencies and clients. The time you share comes at a premium, and billable hours must be spent accomplishing projects, not wading through admin.
Every entry in your project database opens as its own, fully customizable page, meaning your teams can centralize all work for a project in one place.
Here are some things you could include in a project page. To access these, type/, and either search through the menu or start typing what you want.
----
Text— draft blog posts or press releases right in Notion. You can also create headers, bulleted lists, and more to add some texture to your writing. Learn more aboutwriting and editing basics.
Links— add links as hypertext or using aweb bookmark. This is great for design agencies, so clients can share examples or inspiration. You can even useNotion's Web Clipperto send links straight from your browser into Notion pages whenever you see something valuable online.
Media— drop an image, video, document or audio file directly into the page. This lets anyone see designs, logos, or videos without navigating out of Notion. A full list of options can be found when you type/media.
----
Embeds— you can embed Figma files, Abstract projects, Miro boards, GitHub Gists, and more. Designers and creatives may need various tools to complete their projects, but Notion brings everything together on one page. Here's afull list of embeds.
Notion brings all your tools together in one, so teammates can always find what they’re looking for and collaborate more effectively.
You can start a conversation with anyone either in the comments section at the top of a Notion page, or by commenting on specific things throughout the page.
----
Comments allow you to collaborate with teammates or clients, keeping feedback loops tight. They also save time — no one wants to be culling feedback from across different pieces of software, making sure everything is accounted for. When nothing's missed, incorrect or duplicative work is far less likely to happen.
There are two ways to comment:
Page comments— use the comment section at the top of a page for general, high-level comments. For example, sign-off a project with a comment to say “I’ve reviewed the final changes and this is ready to go!”
----
Block comments— leave comments on blocks anywhere on a page. This is handy when suggesting edits to a blog post, or giving feedback on individual designs. Click⋮⋮next to the block, and selectComment.
You can tag people or pages in comments by typing@, followed by someone’s name or the name of a page. You can also type@followed by the date to tag a date in your comment, which is perfect for reminders or deadlines for collaborators. Click on this date to customize it by adding a time, date range, or time zone.
Find outall you need to know about comments here.
----
Many creative agencies spend a lot of time designing sleek presentations to showcase their work to clients. As well as taking a lot of effort, these presentations may feel static and inflexible.
Instead, why not invite your clients into the workshop? By presenting straight from Notion you can save time and let clients see behind the scenes. If you have a meeting scheduled, invite them to the page by sharing a link or adding them as a guest.
----
Together, you can look through all the work-in-progress in real-time, and as you get their feedback and discuss changes or revisions, you can take notes and comments directly in the document. Not only does this save time on note-taking and task-setting, but it also helps your clients get involved, and feel like you are listening to their opinions and acting on them.
Design agencyMetaLabhas started doing client presentations this way. Design Lead, Lee Giles, says, "Notion creates a great opportunity for us to make workflow collaboration two-way between us and the client.“

How marketing and sales teams can enhance creativity and productivity with Notion AI
Customer-facing teams  have to get their wording right. Every piece of content you publish — from blog posts and Tweets to sales pitches and newsletters — must be on-brand and persuasive.
But, it can be exhausting for busy teams to achieve both the quality and quantity of content you require.
Notion AI is here to help your team consistently come up with brilliant ideas and craft perfectly-worded content in a fraction of the time it used to take.
----
The best part? There’s no need to go back and forth, copying and pasting from one tool to another. Your connected Notion AI assistant is always on hand to help with your work — right in the place where you already do your work.
Notion AI can help marketers and salespeople draft anything, from blog posts to sales emails and to-do lists.
In this guide, you’ll learn how marketing and sales teams can use Notion AI to:
Write and edit social media captions
Outline, draft, and refine a blog post
Craft a perfect email
Extract insights from survey data
Generate an endless supply of ideas
But first, a quick intro to the technology behind Notion AI.
Notion AI works the same way as most Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology:
----
It looks for patterns in a massive set of data, referred to as training data, to create a machine learning model
It tests its machine learning model by asking a question it already knows the answer to and analyzing how accurate its answer is. The data the AI uses here is called test data.
Over time and with more inputs and training data, it learns and iterates on the machine learning model
Using this process, Notion AI can generate text, brainstorm ideas, improve writing, translate, summarize, and much more. It considers all the data it has access to, plus the context of the page you're on, and produces text in response to your questions.
Rate AI content with thumbs-up or thumbs-down
----
As with all kinds of AI technology, responses can sometimes be inaccurate or misleading.Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to report great or not-so-great Notion AI responses. This helps our engineers improve the technology for everyone!You can read more about the limitations of AIhere.
To get started with Notion AI, navigate to a new line and press thespacekey.
Notion AI will then ask you to input a prompt. You can ask for anything - try asking AI to define a concept (such as AI), brainstorm ideas on a topic, or create an outline for a document.
Here’s a brief overview of some things Notion AI can do:
----
Create asummary of a lengthy doc— Ask AI to summarize the content of a page, and it will generate a short paragraph. This can be helpful to include in many of your documents and pages.
Extract themes from data, or create action items— Notion AI can consider all information on a page and produce key takeaways like the themes, trends, or even a list of action items from a meeting note.
Turn bullet points into a fully-fledged doc— You can quickly turn a few messy bullets into a complete document with the help of Notion AI, which will fill in the gaps and expand on your ideas.
----
Improve your writing and grammar— Give your writing an instant makeover with Notion AI, which will fix spelling and grammar mistakes and improve your sentences. You can even change the tone to make your writing sound more on-brand.
Generate content in a flash— No more staring at a blank page or struggling to get started. Notion AI can generate text in seconds based on your prompts and refine and edit until you’re happy with your content.
Now let’s zoom in and discover how to use these tools in your daily marketing and sales process.
----
Writing with AI isn’t simply about automatically generating and publishing content but rather, using the technology to augment your writing, expand on your ideas and improve your writing while streamlining the creation process.
Notion AI can help you automate manual tasks and develop and refine your ideas to create unique, valuable content that contributes to wider marketing and sales goals — from lead generation to closing deals.
It takes time and energy for your marketing team to constantly come up with fresh content ideas, for example, for your daily social media posts.
----
Notion AI can help you come up with new topics and perspectives you hadn’t thought of, so you can consistently publish engaging content and achieve your social media goals.
Dream up endless ideas for social media posts— If you’re running out of inspiration, ask Notion AI toBrainstorm ideasfor social media posts about a topic.
Generate rough drafts of posts in seconds— To draft a social media post, selectSocial media postin the AI menu and explain what you want to write about and what channel it’s for.
----
Compare different versions by rewriting the content— You can ask AI to write multiple versions of the draft you just generated. Highlight the text, and clickAsk AI. Then you can selectContinue writing,Make longer, or ask AI to rewrite differently.
Get your tone of voice spot on— If your writing sounds off, you can clickChange toneand choose whether you want the text to sound more professional, casual, confident, friendly, etc.
Automatically proofread before you publish—  You’ll probably want to give your post a once over before you publish. When you’re done, ask Notion AI to Fix spelling & grammar to catch any typos or mistakes.
----
You know you want to publish blog content consistently, to educate your users, establish your expertise, boost your SEO ranking and help you attract potential customers.
Notion AI can save you time on outlining, drafting and editing, and publishing long-form content and make it easier to collaborate with your team and contractors.
Some tips for crafting a blog post with Notion AI:
Quickly draw up your content briefs for the month— To get started with blog posts, you can ask AI to help you create a brief and an outline which you’ll then share with writers.
----
Turn a few bullet points into a rough draft— Ask AI to write a draft of a blog post based on some bulleted ideas, and then ask it to Continue writing to expand further. Within minutes, those few messy bullets will become a fully-fledged draft.
Polish your draft until it’s ready to go live— Work alongside AI to optimize your writing. Correct mistakes, adjust your tone, and write and rewrite different sections of your post until you're happy with the result.
Reduce the manual work of editing— You can ask AI to simplify complex language, remove technical jargon or, say, replace all names in a post with fake ones, and avoid time-consuming, manual editing work.
----
Extend your reach across the globe— Notion AI can translate your blog post into another language, so you and your sales reps or marketing teams can broaden your horizons and build a global audience.
Once you’ve finished your blog post, why not ask Notion AI to write a summarize the content? You can then use this as an excerpt, inspiration for your meta description, or even repurpose it as a social media post.
Repurpose your long-form content using summaries
You can use an AI-generated summary of a blog post or user research doc to kickstart a social media post.
You likely send a range of emails during a sales cycle - feature updates, onboarding sequences, drip campaigns, and more.
----
It’s crucial to get the tone just right, and this will vary depending on whether you’re announcing a feature update, onboarding new sign-ups, or warming up subscribers.
Notion AI can act as your sales assistant, helping you draft and edit your emails and adjust your tone of voice and content according to the segment and context.
Surveys help you gather customer data and feedback, which helps everyone in your organization know how to improve your customer experience
But all the data that comes in can be difficult to parse, especially if you have a lot of customer interactions and capture freeform responses in your surveys.
Notion AI can scan data sets and transform lengthy responses into snappy insights.
----
This means everyone can get an overview of customer sentiment without painstakingly going through all the survey responses one by one.
To do this, selectFind action itemson a page or ask Notion AI to extract insights or summarize your survey results. You can also do this to surface important takeaways from a sales call or meeting note.
You might even try asking AI for help with lead generation or lead scoring based on data from an event follow-up. Or, try asking it for help qualifying leads when you have too many responses to sort through, to help with prioritization and decision-making.
Pull insights from data with AI
----
Try this prompt to get the main takeaways and themes from your survey data 👇”Analyze the data below, identify 5 top insights, and include customer quotes. Return the list as bullet points.”
Notion AI can be your infinitely creative brainstorming partner and instantly generate a wealth of ideas to write about, so you’ll never have to worry about running out of inspiration.
To start brainstorming, open the AI menu and selectBrainstorm ideas about. Customize the prompt by describing what kind of ideas you want to come up with.
----
Delve deeper into the topic by giving more specific, descriptive prompts. For example, you could ask Notion AI to suggest possible ways to solve a problem, provide alternative perspectives, or identify the risks and benefits of a particular solution.
You can use this feature for your internal content workflows, too. So, if you need to create a job description, you can ask Notion AI to help you draw up a list of desired skills and qualities for account executives in real-time.
You can generate amazing content from scratch with AI by writing a few great prompts and follow-up prompts.
----
If you give detailed and specific prompts, you’ll likely be happier with the result. Include as much information in your prompts as possible. Explain the type of content or document you want (blog post, press release, feature launch announcement, etc) and the topic to be covered.
Finally, include the format of the expected output. This is where you’ll explain whether you want the content formatted as bullet points, a table, or anything else!
By being specific and providing context, you'll get more relevant output from the AI system.
----
If you're not satisfied with the initial output, don't worry! You can always use Notion AI like a chatbot. Try asking AI to edit the text, improve writing, make it longer or shorter, make the tone friendlier, and more.

How Notion can help your marketing team stay organized and efficient
Your marketing team could be working on dozens of projects, collaborating with different teams, external agencies or clients, and using numerous tools.
Though you’ve started using Notion, you’re still going back and forth between tools, not just paying the subscription fees, but also the implicit cost of context switching throughout the day.
The result? Information is scattered, it’s hard for your team to find what they need, and everything takes longer than it should.
----
Notion can consolidate all aspects of your work into a single workspace, where you outline goals and initiatives, define guidelines and processes, plan projects, complete tasks and collaborate seamlessly. You even have a powerful AI assistant to help you write, edit, summarize, generate ideas and more.
In this guide, we’ll show you the power of a connected workspace and how your marketing team can achieve more flow-state, less context switching with Notion.
If all your information is fragmented across different tools, folks aren’t sure where to find what they need and it takes time to locate relevant information.
----
But by creating a team wiki in Notion you can eliminate silos and bring your knowledge into one central hub that all team members can access.
This team wiki, or knowledge base, will become an ever-expanding library of useful content. Team members can review information relevant to their role, and everyone can work with accurate knowledge.
We recommend organizing your knowledge base into an easy to navigate wiki format, with a home page and sub-pages branching out into different topics, so team members can quickly access information on a self-serve basis. You can arrange the pages into columns, and add more pages within those sub-pages.
----
Start with our team wiki template and customize it according to your marketing team’s needs. You can include brand guidelines, team directory, goals and objectives, handbooks, standard operating procedures, onboarding process, educational material and more.
Here are some tips for building your marketing team knowledge base:
Save time by importing your existing content— Already got team docs saved in other tools? You can import Word docs, text files, HTML and more straight into Notion, as well as data from apps like Evernote and Google docs.
----
Use analytics to see how team members engage with content— You can use page and workspace analytics to see how many times a page has been viewed and by who, when a page was last edited, which team members are most active and more. This can help you keep your knowledge base content fresh and helpful.
Give everyone the right level of access to content— Use permission settings to adjust which team members can view, edit and share pages. Learn more about permission settings here.

Effective project management is vital for marketing teams juggling many tasks at once.
----
Unlike some tools, which can be process-heavy and inflexible, Notion gives you the freedom to create your ideal project management system and make it as simple or detailed as you wish. And, project management lives side by side with your work and documents, which helps everyone to be more productive and see the full context behind their work.
Use two separate Notion databases to manage your team’s tasks and projects. First, copy our project management templates into your workspace, and review our projects and tasks guide to learn how to use these databases. Then, customize your databases according to how your team works best.
Here are some things you can do with your projects and tasks databases:
----
Tag tasks with a variety of properties— Properties add layers of information to each item in a database. The projects and tasks database templates come with useful properties like status, assignee, due date, etc. You can add any other properties that make sense for your work, such as a select property to categorize different types of projects, or advanced properties like sub-tasks and dependencies to split tasks into smaller actions.
Connect your daily tasks to projects— Projects and tasks are linked with a relation property. This means you can attach individual tasks to larger initiatives and track how close you are to completing a project.
----
Create different layouts and filtered views of the same database— You can arrange one database in many different ways. Create different layouts like board view, calendar or timeline, and filter views to show sub-sets of information - such as projects currently in progress, or tasks assigned to you.
Use project pages to collect project information— Instead of just linking out to other tools, your work can live inside project pages in Notion. Use the project page to embed files or content from other tools, outline the project brief, attach relevant images and more.
----
Use templates and recurring tasks to automate work— You can create database templates to help you write new project briefs or outlines quickly. If you have repeating tasks that need to be done on a weekly or monthly basis (clear your inbox, review goals or send weekly team update email, for example) you can set a task to recur at regular intervals. This saves you having to remember to keep adding it to the database.
You can also create more databases to manage your marketing work. For example, create a content calendar using a board layout, grouped by status. Here, you can plan and assign upcoming content, and drag and drop cards to change their status.
----
Or, use a calendar view database to schedule social media posts or track upcoming launches. You could then relate your launch calendar to tasks and projects so you know what needs to be completed in time for launch.
Templates & resources for your marketing projects
Click to expand
Most of the time, your notes and documents are separate from your team wiki and project management. But in Notion, everything is combined - you’ll create documents, organize them, and even align them with other aspects of your work, all in the same tool.
----
There are endless ways to customize a Notion page, with text blocks, columns, headings, lists, images, embeds and much more. So, you can create visually interesting documents quickly, and use Notion AI to save more time. Just hit the spacebar and ask AI to help you write or outline any kind of document and with you can get the job done fast with minimal edits.
----
Create a docs database in Notion (we have a templatehere) which will become your team’s digital filing cabinet. Every document can be categorized and tagged with relevant properties to signify the type of document, when it was created, by who, when it was last edited, who’s currently working on it, etc. Your marketing team could use the docs database to create a new client profile, project scope, audience research documents and more.
----
As with any Notion database, you can create templates pre-loaded with prompts and information to help you create different types of documents quickly. Not only does this make it quicker to create documents, it also helps you set a standard for your documents and make sure they keep the same format across the board.
You can also use the relation property to connect documents to projects, or your client database if you have one.

Meetings are an essential part of your working week - they help your marketing team gather ideas, get aligned and figure out next actions. They also keep everyone accountable and ensure progress is made.
But without carefully planned agendas and a note-taking system, you can end up having way more meetings than you need, and not getting enough value from them. Even if you do take notes, they could end up buried in an unknown file, never referenced again.
A meeting notes database in Notion is the perfect way to get more intentional about meetings. Make sure every meeting has a clear agenda, action items and takeaways, and keep a record of every meeting that you can easily refer back to later.
----
Duplicate ourmeeting notestemplate to start documenting your meetings.
Here are some ways the meeting notes database can help you:
Label every meeting with a category— Use select property to create different tags for different types of meetings - from your weekly sync to your daily stand ups, project kickoffs, all hands and more. You can also create database templates for these meeting types, with headers, bullets and to-do list ready to go so all you have to do is create a new one and fill it in with your agenda and notes.
----
Tag everyone who attended— With the person property you can tag all team members who attend a meeting. This can come in handy later when you want to check who was present at a meeting. People can also filter the database to show all meetings they’ve attended (or missed).
----
Include action items at the end of meeting notes— Make sure all action items are captured in a checklist at the end of the meeting notes. You can use the @ to tag team members in those items. Better yet, create a button in your meeting note template to add items directly to your tasks database. This saves you having to remember to add the tasks later and ensures nothing will get missed. You can even add an AI block in the button to generate summaries of content even faster. Learn more about buttonshere.
Relate meeting notes to projects—  Building connections between databases gives you a  more complete picture of work. Add a relation property to meeting notes and connect each note to a relevant project.

In Notion, you can weave together all the different elements of your work into one connected workspace.
Here are a some Notion features that will enhance connectivity in your team’s work:
Connect relevant pages with relations— A relation property links one database to another. Once databases are related, you can pull specific information from one database to another using a rollup. Learn more about how relations and rollups work.
----
Grab your teammates attention by tagging them anywhere— If you want to bring someone’s attention to something you can type @ and their name to tag them. This will notify them and therefore make sure they see it. You can also link to other pages in a block of text so easily reference other information and make it easy for readers to find.
Collaborate on documents using comments and mentions— If multiple people are editing a document, you can leave comments on sections of text and tag people, these comments can later be resolved, which makes for smooth editing process. You can also leave comments at the top of the page and tag people.
----
Bring relevant docs, tasks, and knowledge into your OKR page— You can track an OKR or quarterly initiatives in a Notion page. Then, create linked versions of your tasks, projects and documents databases in the page. By applying a filter to only show relevant items, you can see exactly what work needs to get done to achieve your goal.
Find your way back to a previous page using backlinks— At the top of a page you’ll be able to see backlinks, or other pages that link to that page. This can help you quickly get back to where you were or navigate to other useful pages.
----
Organize your sidebar to make it easy to navigate the workspace—  You can customize your Notion sidebar to arrange pages in a logical way and make it easier for team members to find information and get down to work.

How product teams boost productivity and spark new ideas with Notion AI
Your product development team is busy creating new features, running experiments, and documenting your processes on the go. The last thing you want is for frustrating admin tasks to slow you down and hamper progress.
With Notion AI, you can glide through daily work - from brainstorming new ideas to drafting documents, and planning projects to improving your writing, summarizing documents, and highlighting action items and takeaways.
You’ll be able to get more done in a fraction of the time. Plus, you can expand your thinking and spark new ideas with the power of AI and machine learning.
----
The best part? It’s built right into your workspace, meaning your connected AI assistant is always on hand to help with your work - right in the place where you already do your work.
Notion AI can help you draft anything, from a meeting agenda to a pros and cons list.
In this guide, we’ll take a look at three common AI use cases for tech teams:
Writing better docs that everyone can understand
Speeding up manual work and summarizing long texts
Broadening your thinking through creative prompts
But first - let’s start with a general introduction to Notion AI and its capabilities.
Notion AI works the same way as most Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology:
----
It looks for patterns in a massive set of data, referred to as training data, to create a machine learning model
It tests its machine learning model by asking a question it already knows the answer to and analyzing how accurate its answer is. The data the AI uses here is called test data.
Over time and with more inputs and training data, it learns and iterates on the machine learning model
Using this process, Notion AI can generate text, brainstorm ideas, improve writing, translate, summarize, and much more. It considers all the data it has access to, plus the context of the page you're on, and produces text in response to your questions.
Rate AI content with thumbs-up or thumbs-down
----
As with all kinds of AI technology, responses can sometimes be inaccurate or misleading.Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to report great or not-so-great Notion AI responses. This helps our engineers improve the technology for everyone!You can read more about the limitations of AIhere.
To get started with Notion AI, navigate to a new line and press thespacekey.
Notion AI will then ask you to input a prompt. You can ask for anything - try asking AI to define a concept (such as AI), brainstorm ideas on a topic, or create an outline for a document.
Here’s a brief overview of some things Notion AI can do:
----
Create a summary of a lengthy doc— Ask AI to summarize the content of a page, and it will generate a short paragraph. This can be helpful to include in many of your documents and pages.
Extract themes from data, or create action items— Notion AI can consider all information on a page and produce key takeaways like the themes, trends or even a list of action items from a meeting note.
Turn bullet points into a fully-fledged doc— You can quickly turn a few messy bullets into a complete document with the help of Notion AI, which will fill in the gaps and expand on your ideas.
----
Improve your writing and grammar— Make your writing instantly better with Notion AI, which will fix spelling and grammar mistakes and improve your sentences. You can even change the tone to make your writing sound more on-brand.
Generate content in a flash— No more staring at a blank page or struggling to get started to complete your roadmap. Notion AI can generate text in seconds based on your prompts and refine and edit until you’re happy with your content.
Now let’s zoom in and discover how your product development team can use these tools in their daily workflow.
----
Your product development team likely uses technical documents, such as Product Requirement Docs (PRDs), to outline product requirements, features, and functionalities, as well as information about the target audience, user stories, use cases with important stakeholders.
Notion AI can help make product development docs simpler and more transparent so they’re accessible to everyone involved.
Here are some ways you could edit a PRD using Notion AI:
Expand and elaborate on your ideas— You can ask AI toContinue writingorMake longerto extend the content and come up with more ideas.
----
Fix spelling and grammar before sharing with colleagues— To run a grammar and spelling check before sharing your doc, highlight all the text and selectFix spelling & grammar.
Adjust the tone of your writing in one click— Change the tone of your PRD doc to fit your brand voice or make it sound more friendly, casual, or professional. SelectChange toneand choose from the available options.
Add a helpful summary to your document— To summarize, add a new block and chooseSummarize. Notion AI will generate a summary of the page in seconds, which you can drag to the top of the page.
Now, everyone who opens the PRD will be able to understand the doc and get a quick overview of the content.
----
Your engineering team’s process documents can be long and detailed - for anyone who has to review many of these docs, including a summary at the top of the page can be helpful.
In a document like a Request for Comment (RFC), a summary can help the reader get a sense of the context, what’s included in the document, and an overview of the main points. This makes it easier to jump into giving feedback.
You can make summaries a standard part of your process by including an AI summary block in your doc templates.
To do this, go to your docs database and open up your RFC template. Hit the/command to add a new block, scroll down toAI blocksand selectSummary.
----
This will embed an AI block into the template, which already contains instructions for summarizing the page content. Now, every time you finish creating a new RFC from your template, you can go to the summary block and clickGenerateto summarize the content.
Adding this block to your template saves time and helps your team establish a practice of including page summaries by default.
User research can be a goldmine of valuable information for yourdevelopment process.It helps to explain customer satisfaction, understand what users love about your product and highlight features they’d love to see built or improved.
Reading your customers’ feedback helps you set priorities and decide what to build next.
----
However, user feedback can be long-winded and repetitive. With so much data to wrangle, it can take hours to sift through the customer responses to find relevant observations.
Using Notion AI, you can extract key insights and overarching themes from complex texts in real-time. Quickly spot metrics, trends, and patterns, get useful takeaways about your users’ common pain points from your research, and start taking action.
To extract insights from your page, you can generate a page summary and add anAction itemsblock to create a checklist of things to do based on the page content.
You can also create a custom AI prompt asking Notion AI to round up the key takeaways and insights from the page.
----
The beauty of generative AI is that you never have to start from a blank page again. No matter what you want to create, you can call up AI to help you brainstorm, outline and refine your ideas and create polished documents in a matter of minutes.
To get started drafting with Notion AI, head to a blank page and click✨ Start writing with AI…
Here are just a few ways to broaden your creative horizons with Notion AI:
Brainstorm new product ideas— If you need to prepare ideas for an upcoming meeting, Notion AI can be your brainstorming partner. SelectBrainstorm ideasin the AI menu and explain what you want to come up with. You could even ask AI to help you come up with ideas for a feature name!
----
Scope out a project plan— Once you know what iniatives your team will be working on next, you can scope out the project plan in a few minutes using Notion AI. Ask Notion AI to help you write a project brief. It will generate a rough outline that you can customize and complete on your own or with more assistance from AI.
Create content strategy and briefs— You can also ask Notion AI to help you develop a content strategy relevant to a new feature launch. Collaborate with your marketing team using Notion AI to generate suggested topics and create briefs and outlines for articles.
----
Draft documents from scratch— Put together a scrappy first draft of any kind of document in minutes - from feature specs to press releases or job descriptions. Ask Notion AI to help you write, edit, refine, and continue writing until you have a workable draft to share with your team.
Turn action items into tasks to do— Quickly add tasks to your team’s to-do list by asking Notion AI to Find action items in a document like a project scope or meeting note.
You can generate amazing content from scratch with AI tools by writing a few great prompts and follow-up prompts.
----
If you give detailed and specific prompts, you’ll likely be happier with the result. Include as much information in your prompts as possible. Explain the type of content or document you want (project scope, product strategy, PRD, technical spec, product design, etc) and the topic to be covered.
Finally, include the format of the expected output. This is where you’ll explain whether you want the content formatted as bullet points, a table, or anything else!
By being specific and providing context, you'll get more relevant output from AI.
----
If you're not satisfied with the initial output, don't worry! You can always use AI like a chatbot and ask for iterations. Try asking AI to edit the text, improve writing, make it longer or shorter, make the tone friendlier, and more.
However, it's important not to over-engineer your prompts, as the whole point of using AI is to save yourself time.

How startups conduct user research using Notion
Notion makes it easy to collect and organize user feedback so that it is visible, sortable, and easier to use.
From your workspace, create a table database from scratch. Add custom properties—pieces of information of about each entry—to specify the research type, date, interviewee’s name, interviewee’s email, and interviewer.
Every table entry is a page in itself, where you can store all the information about an interview. For clarity purposes, add a table of contents at the top.
To standardize the process, build templates for different research types. To do this, click on the downwards arrow at the top right of the table, then onNew template.

How teams can use comments for better collaboration
Long feedback threads spread across email, chat, and other apps are far from ideal. It becomes a full-time job keeping track of what everyone’s said and if it has been accounted for.
When comments happen in Notion, you don’t need to go searching for a stakeholder’s input or ping them for feedback. All comments live in one place, keeping projects on deadline and providing a better collaboration space.
In Notion there are two types of comments:
----
Page comments— at the top of every page, there’s a space where you can add high-level comments about things that apply to an entire page. For example, this might be where you let another team know you’ve completed a draft and need their feedback. To start the dialogue, clickAdd a commenton the top of any Notion page.
Where to find the page comments section
Click to expand
----
2.Block comments— leave comments on an entire block, whether that’s specific paragraphs, images, videos, and other embeds. You might be working on a project to redesign your login page, where engineers comment on the code block and designers comment on the layout mockups. Add a comment to any content block by clicking⋮⋮to the left of it. Then selectCommentfrom the pop-up menu.
How to leave in-line feedback
Click to expand
You or someone else on your team likely needs to ensure projects move full steam ahead. With comments, type@and you can:
----
Tag people— ask questions or request feedback from specific teammates. Type@, start typing their name, and then select them within thePeoplesection. If you mention someone on a page that they don't have access to (such as your private pages), they won't receive a notification. You’ll first need toshare the page with themand then tag away. Teammates can respond to comments, creating a thread. And when the discussion is over, you can resolve the comment.
----
Reference other Notion pages— point to other Notion pages in your workspace underLink to Page. Let’s say you’re discussing new features to prioritize on your roadmap. You can link specific feedback from your user research database to help you make your case. Type@and start typing the name of the page you want to reference.
Leave a timestamp— working with teammates worldwide, you can set clear deadlines on when a project is due. Type@1/12and you’ll seeJan 12, 2020as the timestamp. Click the date to customize it further. You can add a specific time, date range, and timezone.
If you need to update or delete any comments, hover over your comments and click the•••icon for options to edit, delete or resolve.
----
A quick breakdown of your notifications
Click to expand
The most important part of better collaboration is figuring out what works best for your team. Here are tips from Notion to help you lead on-page discussions.
Outline your review process— specify with your team the stakeholders you need input from so you can avoid having too many cooks in the kitchen. Then tag them to ensure they provide feedback. If there will be multiple rounds of feedback and revisions, establish the exact number with your team before kicking off a project. This is especially helpful if you’re an agency working to get sign off from clients on a final round of edits and need to avoid scope creep.
----
Set a window for input— move projects forward faster by specifying a deadline for feedback as a top-of-page comment. You can also keep your projects humming along by tagging someone and including the deadline to complete a task. The best way to do this as a comment is to use the@symbol to mention their name and the date on the same line. If they don’t resolve the comment by that deadline, they’ll receive a reminder as an update on their sidebar.
Guide conversations— steer project discussions by leaving your own comments. Note what reviewers should be looking out for in your content. For example, if you want a product marketer’s thoughts on positioning a new feature on your updated landing page, tag them in a specific section.
----
Never miss a notification— turn on email or push notifications in theSettings & Memberssection of your sidebar.

How to build an effective go-to-market (GTM) plan
A Go-To-Market (GTM) plan outlines the strategy and steps for launching a new product or feature. Create one in Notion in just a few steps.
Add a new page to your Projects database, and call it GTM Plan.
The showcased Projects database already boasts properties, which are pieces of information about each entry. These include the project’s timeline, launch date, DRI (Directly Responsible Individual), collaborators, and priority level.
Use headers to structure your document around sections. In this case, there are three: About, Execution, and Launch Day.
Include links to other Notion pages anywhere you deem relevant.
Add a table of contents at the top for easy navigation.
----
Add checklists to create action items,@-mentionteam members, and include dynamic dates.
Create another table database inside your page to keep track of deliverables.
Use Notion’sRelationproperty to link all meeting notes associated to your GTM plan.

How to build a wiki for your company
Imagine there’s only one set of keys to your office.
When you don’t have a central home for your company’s information — like employee benefits, office guidelines or policies — you’re basically passing around that one set of keys to everyone.
Every time an employee needs to access company fundamentals or wants to know where to find something, they waste time asking for the keys. Over time, this cripples productivity and scale.
Building a company wiki benefits the entire organization. It consolidates essential information, makes it accessible to everyone and keeps everything up to date — whether it’s a process everyone should follow or a document that needs to be read.
----
Here, we’ll walk you through building your own company wiki (also called a knowledge base) using Notion, and show you how it can save time and help your team grow.
How to create a wiki for your company, step by step.
How to customize it to match your organization's needs.
How to use features and integrations that are beneficial specifically for HR leaders and others who want to build a company-wide wiki.
Here’s an example of what your company’s wiki could look like:
If employees don’t know where to access company documents, then you probably lack a central hub for information. Every question about company-related materials should start at the same place — and a folder full of pages with no connections or hierarchy doesn’t count.
----
Your team deserves a single resource for:
Benefits, PTO, expenses, office guidelines and more — all your policies, up to date with the latest information, so people can view them whenever they need to.
Onboarding processes, so new employees can access (and go back to reference) the information they need to start doing important work.
Company announcements, quarterly or annual goals and mission & strategy documents that foster transparency between executives and employees.
To be sure, consolidating these resources will save time for you and employees. Instead of asking someone, team members already know where to go for the answer.
----
But other benefits cascade down from having this mountain of information. It thwarts confusion and misinformation spread, because everyone is working off the same set of documents. It makes updating canonical docs simple, because it only needs to happen in one place. It welcomes collaboration, because employees can read and revisit tentpole company information.
Your wiki is the set of digital keys to your company that employees new and old share.
Let’s start with a few basics and work our way up from there.
Often, each team at a company will have their own workspace page in Notion (one for engineering, one for marketing, etc.). Think of your shared company information as a team, too.
----
It needs its own page. And inside that page will be other pages to help you organize company documents, plans or processes. Pages can contain anything, from text to videos to databases.
To create a page, hit the+sign next toWORKSPACEin your sidebar. Already inside a page? Just hit/, then typepageand press enter.
When you hit/, you’ll see a full menu of content options you can add to a page. This is called the “slash command.”
Because you now have one place for company information, distributing this knowledge happens with a single click. Instead of needing to update docs in many places, collect them all, and share multiple times, now you can just direct everyone to your org-wide Notion page.
These templates can help get you started
----
Click to expand
The beauty of building a company wiki in Notion is the ability to put many pages inside of one page. This makes for supreme organization of all your most important documents.
For example, you can have separate pages in your wiki for benefits, company policies, a team directory, or announcements. These pages all become resources for your employees — and live side-by-side the work you and your team are doing.
To make a sub-page inside of an existing page, type/pageand press enter. Your new page will pop up. Give it a title and add any content you want. Use the back button to return to your wiki.
----
Maybe you want to make many pages at once. List all the pages you want as text. Then, select them all, click the⋮⋮that appears when you hover, clickTurn Intoand selectPage.
Work and a knowledge base inform each other constantly. You can write a memo on why you’re switching benefits providers in the same workspace as your wiki, making it easy to refer to at any time.
Plus, now your employees know exactly where to go when they need something. Instead of asking you, they can find all these pages from themself. They can even use Notion’s search function. At the top left of your sidebar, there’s aQuick Findbutton for all searches. You can also hitctrlorcmd+pto execute the search function.
----
Now that you have the pieces of a wiki, here’s how you can put them together.
Link out to information from many other sources
Click to expand
A clearly-organized wiki makes finding information a no-brainer.
Every company is different, so Notion allows you to customize how your wiki is set up so that it matches your workflow and your team. Other tools feel like you’re working with a slab of marble, rigid and unbending. Notion is like working with malleable clay.
Headers are the way to go. Using/again, choose the header size you want fromH1(the largest),H2orH3(the smallest). You can now drag-and-drop different pages under these headers inside your company wiki.
----
We’ve found that columns tend to be the cleanest way to organize collections of pages.
To make a column, you’ll use drag-and-drop again. Grab the⋮⋮icon next to a header, then drag it all the way over to the right to create another column. The blue guides will help.
Again using⋮⋮, grab any page and drag it into the section where it belongs.
For an even tidier look, add divider lines under your headers by typing three hyphens in a row.
A category like “Benefits” might have pages for “Insurance,” “Commuter,” and “Stipends.” A category like “Tech” might have pages for “Security” and “Tools.”
----
If a new employee joins your team, think about how easy it will be for them to get started. Everything’s here for them. They know exactly where to go for information and how to reference it again later — instead of asking someone multiple times.
Even seasoned employees can return to the wiki anytime they need something. When policies change, the wiki serves as a living repository of information so you can spend less time fielding questions.
Add your brand — or some personality — to your pages
Click to expand
When creating a company wiki, you might want to keep some information private, or make sure it’s only accessible by a few people. In Notion, sharing and gating documents happens with a single click.
----
Permissions in Notion trickle down — if your company wiki is shared with your entire team, all employees can access all the pages within the wiki. So, if there’s info you’d like kept between only a few people, we suggest creating a separate page for that. It’ll go in thePRIVATEsection of your sidebar. Once you share it, it’ll go into theSHAREDsection of the sidebar.
Of course, this can get a bit more complicated at the company level. You may want some teams to be able to see information that others can’t. You may want a section that only the engineering team can edit while everyone else can only view.
Here’s how to get granular with permissions.
----
To set up permission groups, go to theSettings & Memberssection at the top of your sidebar, then selectGroups. Here, you can clickCreate a groupand begin adding people to that group. Usually, groups are based on job function, like marketing, engineering, executives, etc.
When it comes time to share the page, go to the top right and clickShare. You’ll then see the different groups you’ve created, includingWorkspace accessif you want to share it with every single member of your workspace.
For the page you’re sharing, you can also choose the type of access you’d like to give the group:Full access,Can edit,Can comment,Can read, orDisabled. Once selecting the level of access, flip the toggle to share that page with the group.
----
Using the above, let’s say you want only your marketing team to be able to edit their page in your workspace. You’d change workspace access to
Can read, create a permission group for your marketing team, and in that page’sSharemenu grant that groupCan editstatus.
If you’d like to share a page with a specific person, from theSharemenu, selectInvite a person. Here, you can search from everyone at your company or invite outside people via email.
You can also make a page public so anyone on the web can view it if they have the link. From theSharemenu, either giveCan readorCan commentaccess, then flip the toggle.
Here’s a 4-minute video for everything you need to know about public pages.
----
And on the flip side, you can also lock a page. Click the•••menu on the top right, then togglePage lock. This prevents accidental edits.
The ability to control who sees what page is essential to building company documentation. Even if this means working on memo with a select few folks before sharing it company-wide, Notion’s permissions put the power in your hands.
This flexibility means that, while employees can access the documents they need to, you can still keep some information private.
The most important part of a wiki is functionality. Here are a few tips to help you customize it to your team’s needs for ultimate usability.
----
Start with an Office Manual page. Inside, it can have information about company policies, required reading, and even your office location. You can put a map right inside this page by typing/map, then pasting the URL from the Google Maps location of your office.
Make your Benefits page the on-stop-shopfor everything benefits-related. Use web bookmarks to centralize all the links your team will need for this important information. You can even embed PDFs alongside these links (like a benefits summary). To download a PDF, hover over a file, hit the•••to the right, then selectDownload.
Your team won’t have to go digging through their email or Dropbox to find the right forms. They can always get them right here.
----
And an Employee Directory page helps the team lean on each other as resources. This is a place where you can share information about all employees, and easily add to the list as your team grows. You can even add an employee’s department, when they started and a photo — this helps everyone put a face to the name.
We recommend using a gallery for this. Just start a new page and chooseGalleryfrom your menu of database options. You’ll be able to customize what information you want to display about each employee, like their title, location, team, favorite dessert, etc. You can also add bios, resumes, or anything else you want to the contents of each person’s page.More on galleries here →
----
And when those employees need a breather?You can create a page just for requesting time offto make it super simple. Use a Typeform embed so employees don’t even have to leave Notion to make a request. Simply hit/typeformthen pressenter.
Visual learner? We created a 7-minute video showing how to build a basic wiki.
A well-built company wiki can serve as your team’s home base — whenever there’s a question about company info or processes, everyone knows exactly where to go.
It’s a powerful tool, and while you still have control over it, sharing that information with others will likely give you back some of the time you’ve spent sharing and re-sharing much of what could be found by employees themselves.
----
A company wiki is an investment in your team and their success. We hope this helps you on the way.

How to build a wiki for your design team
Strong brands are built on strong design.
Setting that foundation requires consistency — your design team must operate using consistent tools, whether it’s a set of process documents, fonts, logos, or HTML color codes. Like a fingerprint, these assets should be the same everywhere your brand touches.
A wiki is your design team’s workshop. Yes, it’s a place for all the tools your team needs to do excellent work. But it’s also a place to initiate new team members into how you work. It’s a place to archive past explorations, iterations and decisions. It’s the fulcrum between design and every other team at the company.
----
Here, we’ll walk you through building your own design wiki in Notion (you might call it a knowledge base), and how it can unlock a better workflow for your team.
How to create a wiki for your design team, step-by-step
How to customize it to match your team's needs
How to use features and integrations that are useful for design specifically
Here's just one example of what your finished product could look like:
Design work is a symphony of many instruments. The right typography. The right image. The right color (for the record, it’s #030303, not #00000). If these assets are scattered around different apps or software, your team lacks a central source of truth, turning beautiful music into dissonant noise.
----
Your design team deserves one reliable resource for:
The important assets needed for your team to get work done — correct images, style guides and more, all up-to-date.
Onboarding resources for new designers to help get them on the right track and contributing quickly.
Pages specific to the projects you're working on (or if you're at an agency, client-specific pages), so everyone knows who's working on what and can get all the context they need.
----
No wiki means inconsistent work — and when design work gets inconsistent, you end up diluting the brand you’ve worked so hard to build. But it’s not just the brand that suffers. Process suffers. You’ve established a system that works for you and your team, and if it’s not documented and accessible, that process won't get followed. At best, this slows everything down. At worst, it creates costly chaos.
One hub for everything creates a culture of self-service, allowing the product team or the marketing team to access things they’d typically have to ask a designer for.Imagine how much time you’d save if someone from sales could pop into your wiki and quickly find the correct logo they need for a pitch deck.
----
A design wiki isn’t just important for your team. It’s important for the entire company.
Let’s start with the basics and work our way up from there.
Almost everything you do in Notion starts with a page. Your design wiki will be a page that you'll add other pages to. These pages can contain just about anything — text, images, videos, databases and more.
To make a page, click the+button next toWORKSPACEon your left sidebar. If you're already inside of a page, hit/and typepage, then press enter.
Your sidebar just got better
----
While the information presented in this guide is still useful, some elements of the sidebar have been updated — making sharing with the right groups easier. Learn about howteamspaces give every team a home for their important work.
Whenever you type/, you'll see a dropdown menu full of content options — we call this a "slash command." And as a designer, we think you'll end up using the slash command a lot to add different types of content to your pages.
Templates can help get you started
Click to expand
The beauty of having a wiki is that it can contain main pages inside of it.
----
That means you can have a page just for brand assets. You can have another for style guidelines. You can have one for team meeting notes, one for inspiration and even one that's a list of your favorite designers everyone should follow on Twitter.
Each of these pages becomes a resource for your team or anyone who needs design materials, for that matter.And everything will be in one place, so you can spend less time searching high and low for the right files.
Remember that, to make a page, you can type/pageand press enter. Your new page will pop up, where you can give it a title and add any content. You can even add some personal flair to your pages by selecting the perfect emoji or cover art.
----
If you'd like to create many pages at once, you can list all of the pages you want to make as text. Select them all, then click the⋮⋮icon, which appears when you hover over the selection. Then clickTurn Intoand choosePage.
Setting up a home for all your information obviously helps your work, but there are other downstream benefits to be had, too.
Onboarding a new designer will never be so easy — they'll have your core design philosophies, documents, iterations and assets collected from day one. They can more quickly get spun up and start doing meaningful work since they have all the tools immediately. And they have this repository of information to return to whenever they need to understand past decisions and how to approach new projects.
----
With all assets centralized, keeping them fresh is simple. Instead of updating them several places, you can do it once in Notion. Nothing slips through the cracks because no cracks exist.
You and everyone on your design team know where the single source of truth is.
You can even add some personality to your pages
Click to expand
Now, all your vital design information lives in your wiki. Let’s organize these pages a bit so you and your team can quickly and easily find whatever you need.
We’ve found that headers are the best way to organize a wiki’s pages.
Using/again, select fromH1(the largest),H2orH3(the smallest) headers.
Now you can use the drag-and-drop feature to nest pages under the appropriate headers.
----
You can also use drag-and-drop to create columns. Grab the⋮⋮icon next to your header and drag it all the way to the right to create another column. The blue lines will help guide you.
To add divider lines under your headers for a clean look, type three hyphens in a row.
And finally, use⋮⋮to grab any pages you want and drag them into the sections where they belong.
Every design team is different, and with Notion, you can customize your wiki based on your team’s needs.
ABrand Assetssection might include pages for "Fonts," "Logos," and "Office Photos." All of these pages can contain the most up-to-date assets, so anyone on your team can use them.
----
AResourcessection could have pages for "Style Guide," "Design Process" and "Tools." This way, anyone on your design team (new or old) can follow the same process and execute consistent work. They can also contribute to your existing processes, using their learnings to help the entire team.
Structuring your wiki like this empowers anyone to find the information they need without disrupting the deep focus of their fellow designers.
Instead of constant pings in Slack, the wiki becomes the starting point for all design questions.
Notion is like a designer's playground. We've got a shed’s worth of tools that are unique to designers, so you can stop working with rigid software that doesn't meet your needs.
----
Within pages, you can embed different types of content and display them however you want. Hit/to see some of the things you can put right into pages, which include:
Images, videos & gifs
PDFs
Figma files
Invision projects
Framer prototypes
Whimsical boards
Miro boards
Loom videos
Abstract projects
You can type/and select from the display menu, or start typing the name to bring them up faster and pressenter. For example,/pdfand/figma.
----
With these tools, designers can turn any page into a visual expression of their work. Next to an image might be a toggle that discusses the design process. Next to a video might be a checklist of things you need to review when providing feedback. You can comment and tag other designers to notify them of changes, review cycles and more.
And now, everything in your design organization has a central place.Stop context-switching and bouncing between tools and tabs — Notion can be your hub that connects everything, so information doesn't get stuck in scattered apps.
----
No other tool fuels the symbiotic relationship between your work and your wiki like Notion does. Instead of your work existing on a single plane, it’s like Notion makes it three-dimensional.
Want to learn everything about comments and discussions in 4 minutes? Watch this.
Your wiki doesn't have to be a collection of pages. It can also be a database, or use databases.
A database is a simple tool to structure and organize information in a variety of ways. To see all the different types of databases you can make, use the slash command. Type/databaseand you can choose from there. But for now, we're focusing on building aGallery.
To make a gallery inside of a page, type/gallery.
----
Treat the cards inside your gallery like any other page you create — they can contain any information you’d like.
The benefit of a gallery is that you can display the information visually. You can even choose what image you’d like shown on the card, the size of the card and more.
For instance, the card for “Tone & Voice” might contain design principles and guidelines. The one for “Icons” will hold icon files and past iterations and explorations. The “Typography” page can house font files and even web embed codes to put those fonts into action. And all of these will put images front and center, while still having all the necessary information you need.
----
Once you’ve created the gallery’s pages and included the correct information, you can choose what you’d like to display on the card by hitting the•••menu button on the top right.
Here, you'll see a button forProperties. Select it, and inside, you can pick what information you'd like displayed on the card when it's in the gallery view. ClickCard previewand choose betweenPage content(the image you put inside the card) orPage cover(the cover image).
Notion helps you put your work on the front page, and it’s customizable enough so that you have the power to decide how it’s displayed.
----
When sharing design work with a client, you want to make sure it looks polished, and you want to make it easy for them to provide feedback. They shouldn't have to jump around tools they might not be literate in, or need to bounce between your work and the project spec to ensure it's being executed correctly.
Notion is flexible enough to serve as the home for all your client work and as a presentation tool.
----
Each client can have their own page. And within that page, each project can have its own page. Here, you can keep all the necessary documentation, images, and background context for that project. You can include a log of meeting notes and docs explaining how decisions got made. This inspires collaboration and makes for a better give-and-take with a client. They can tag you in feedback and make comments without needing to leave the page.
To share a page with a client, hitShareat the top right.
On a Team or Pro Plan, you can invite them as a guest to their own page with their email.
Or, as long as they also use Notion, you can turn onShare to the web, and thenAllow editing. Anyone you share the link with will be able to edit and add comments.
----
Let's say you want to show off your design work in Notion in pure presentation mode before letting a client dig in. You could turn on justShare to the web. This publishes the page on the internet so that anyone with the link can see it, but not comment or edit.
Notion is the one place that brings together all the different pieces of your work with all the different people who matter — presenting it in a way that lets your design shine.
Visual learner? We created a 7-minute video showing how to build a basic wiki:
A structurally-sound wiki can be the foundation for your design function — for executing work, maintaining consistency and growing your team.
----
A wiki isn't only a collection of current work. It's a repository of past learnings. It's a place for brainstorming what's next. It inspires creativity and collaboration among design teams, but also company-wide. It's is your home for everything design-related, so you can focus on building an iconic brand.
Your design wiki is an investment in that brand. We hope this guide helps you along the way.

How to build a wiki for your engineering team
With the right tool, organizing all your team's important information in one place is pretty simple.
But from where you sit now, it probably feels daunting. Information may be scattered. It may be out of date. It may feel like an overpacked suitcase, where you have to pull out everything just to find the right pair of socks.
Trust us. Investing time in building a single, central engineering wiki will pay longterm dividends. Because a bad organizational system snowballs, and it can lead to inefficient work — time wasted looking for the right thing, outdated info, duplicative projects, incorrect processes.
----
Here, we'll walk you through building your own engineering wiki using Notion (you might also call it a knowledge base), and how it can unlock a better workflow for your team.
In this piece, you'll learn
How to create a wiki for your engineering team, step-by-step
How to customize it to match your team's needs
How to use features and integrations that are useful for engineering specifically
Here's just one example of what your finished product could look like:
Ask yourself: where does all your team's information live? If the answer includes multiple destinations, your team probably lacks a central source of truth for documents that are essential to working effectively.
You deserve one reliable resource for:
----
Code style guidelines, your triage rotation, and infrastructure information — all up to date and easily accessible by everyone on your team.
Onboarding resources for new engineers to help them get spun up and productive fast.
Pages specific to the various projects going on inside your engineering team so everyone stays in the know about who's working on what.
No wiki means no hub for this information, which could have downstream effects. Information gets siloed so no one has a complete picture of what's going on. More meetings and conversations get scheduled because that information isn't findable. Work gets inaccurate and inconsistent because an engineer has been using an outdated style guide.
----
An organized and accessible wiki helps alleviate these problems.No more sifting through graveyards of documents all called the same thing (which are probably stale and outdated, anyway).
Everyone on your team knows where to find what they need, so your team can focus on what's important.
Let's start with a few basics and work our way up from there.
This is the starting point for just about everything you do in Notion. A page can contain anything — text, lists, videos, images, databases and more. Your wiki is a page you'll add other pages to.
----
To create a page, just hit the+sign next toWORKSPACEin your sidebar. If you're already inside a page, simply hit/and typepagethen pressenter. Every time you hit/, you'll see your full menu of content options — we call this a "slash command."
You can also start with a template
Click to expand
Here's the crux of making a wiki — you can have many pages inside of one page.
For example, inside your main Engineering page, you can have separate pages for your code repository, team meeting notes, testing guidelines and more. Each of these pages becomes a resource for your team and can live side-by-side.
----
To make one, type/pageand pressenter. Your new page will pop up, where you can give it a title and add any content. Use the back button to return to your wiki.
To make many pages at once, list all the page names you want as text. Now select them all, click the⋮⋮icon that appears on hover, clickTurn Intoand selectPage.
This way, all the parts of your engineering organization live in one place.Your team doesn't have to go on a scavenger hunt anytime they need something — they know to start at your wiki.
You now have the bones of a wiki. Time to organize it.
Add personality to your pages with emojis and cover art
Click to expand
Let's organize your wiki for ultimate usability.
----
You can start with headers. Using/again, select fromH1(the largest),H2orH3(the smallest) headers. Now you can use the drag-and-drop feature to organize the pages in your workspace.
First, use drag-and-drop to create columns. Grab the⋮⋮icon next to your header, and drag it all the way to the far right to create another column. The blue guides will help you.
To add divider lines under your headers for a polished look, simply type three hyphens in a row.
Now, again using⋮⋮, grab any pages and drag them into the sections where they belong.
A category like "Infrastructure" might include "AWS" and "Redis" pages. All engineering teams are different, and Notion allows you to customize your wiki based on your team's needs.
----
Everything is accessible within a click or two. So forget about hunting for documents.Save your team valuable time by creating a clearly-structured wiki that provides signposts to all the information people need. Notion then becomes the starting point for your team's work.
The tools an engineer needs to do their job are different than other teams. Notion meets those needs so your team can stop shoehorning information into software that isn't flexible.
Within pages, you can embed different types of content to display your information. Hit/to see some of the things you can create (among many others):
Code blocks in any language
A gist from Github
Diagrams
Figma files
Math equations in LaTeX
----
You can either select these options from the menu that pops up or start typing their name to bring them up faster and pressenterto add them. For example,/githuband/math.
We've found that code blocks are especially helpful for engineering teams to share information vital to process and consistency. To add one, type/codeand pressenter.
Click the dropdown at the bottom right of the box that appears to select which language you want to use. Type or paste in any code you want to share with your team, whether that's a command to run for deployment, or commonly used commands.
----
Notion's flexibility allows many kinds of information to exist in one place — so for a project you're working on, a singular page can have everything you need to take it from idea to launch. No more bouncing between tools and tabs. Stop context switching and get more done.
Watch our 3-minute video that teaches you everything you need to know about code blocks
You can nest infinite pages in your wiki. And once it's all set up, you can access all its pages right from the sidebar.
Let's say that, within your engineering wiki, there's a page for "Teams." Within the "Teams" page are individual pages for the sub-teams that are part of your engineering org: iOS, Android, Web, Mac, Windows, etc.
----
This structure ensures every document has its place so you don't have a bunch of uncategorized mystery documents floating around without homes. This also makes it easy for teams to access all the documents nested inside of these pages.
That can happen right from the sidebar with just a couple clicks.
Visual learner? We created a 7-minute video showing how to build a basic wiki.
A well-built wiki can act as the hub for all the spokes of your engineering team.
It connects everyone. It moves projects forward. It unlocks better workflows. And with Notion, you can customize it to match how your team works.
Setting up an engineering wiki is an investment in your team and their work. We hope this helps you on the way.

How to build a wiki for your product team
If your company is a wheel, the product team is the hub and product managers are the spokes. Most of them operate solo within the context of cross-functional teams, connecting many different disciplines while needing to remain connected to each other, too.
That requires supreme organization, a deep understanding of other teams’ work, and an ability to show everyone company-wide how it’s all coming together.
----
With everyone working across projects, a wiki anchors PMs to the important information they need — like process guides, user feedback, and who’s working on what. Without a wiki, no one follows consistent steps to solve a problem. No one communicates. Wheels spin, but don’t really go anywhere, and the quality of the end product suffers.
An effective wiki connects your PMs through documented standards and practices everyone on your team can access, streamlining execution and upholding transparency.
Here, we'll walk you through building your own product team wiki using Notion (some of you might call it a knowledge base), and show you how it can save time, lead to healthier collaboration, and result in a much better experience for your users.
----
How to create a wiki for your product team, step by step.
How to customize it to match your team'’s needs.
How to use features and integrations that are beneficial specifically for product managers.
At the end, you'll be able to build a wiki like this for your product team:
If you’re going to build something people love, you need a wiki that enables your product team to grow and execute to a high standard. Without centralized documentation, your team will become increasingly disorganized with high fluctuation in quality.
Even if you do have guides and principles, they may be scattered and inaccessible. That's basically the same as not having them at all.
Your team deserves a single resource for:
----
Teams, roles, squads and their tasks — a directory of who's responsible for what features and products, what teams they’re working with, and how they're solving big problems together.
A neatly organized table of past learnings from user feedback, customer interviews and projects, each tagged so they’re easy to find and turn into actionable product improvements.
A reference point for everything your team does, which can be used by new and existing team members — OKRs and goals, onboarding resources, dashboards of data from experiments and your core product-building philosophies.
A clearly organized wiki becomes your product's standard-bearer, holding together PMs fanned out across projects. It gives them a playbook.
----
Before, PMs wasted time searching for the right information to do their jobs. Now, they know it’s in the wiki: shared learnings, a standardized process, conversations with users, areas of ownership, goals, and more. A wiki might be the single most high-leverage resource for your product team because it’s the place where all your most important documents converge.
Notion makes it easy to create, update and maintain.
We'll show you the basics, then you can build upon them.
Just about everything you do in Notion starts with a page. In fact, your wiki is a page in which you'll add other pages.
Your sidebar just got better
----
While the information presented in this guide is still useful, some elements of the sidebar have been updated — making sharing with the right groups easier. Learn about howteamspaces give every team a home for their important work.
Pages can contain just about anything — text, images, videos, databases, code blocks and more. Think of pages like a ball of clay you can shape to meet your needs.
You might have a page inside your wiki that documents the history of your product. It’d contain screenshots that showcase the product’s evolution, a list of team members responsible for the changes, and a memo for each iteration, providing context for why you made that change in the first place (which otherwise might be lost).
----
To create a page, you can do it two ways:
Hover over your sidebar on the left and next toWORKSPACE, click the+sign. The page will go under yourWORKSPACEsection where everyone on your team can access it.
If you're already inside a page, simply hit/and typepage. Whenever you hit/, you'll see a full menu of content options — we call this a "slash command."
We have pre-made templates to get you started
Click to expand
Your most important documents are all sub-pages inside your team’s wiki. One for goals and OKRs. One for user research. One for a team directory. Each is separate and actionable, but together, they comprise the foundation of your team.
----
What’s unique about Notion is that your most vital information lives side-by-side the work you and your team are doing. Imagine conducting an interview with a user, and you find a particular set of questions is helpful for showcasing the problem they are experiencing. You can hop right into your team’s guide for user interviews and, in seconds, update the template of questions every PM uses. Your entire team learns from one PM’s experience and takes those learnings forward.
Use a slash command to add pages inside a page:
Type/pageand pressenter. Your new page will open, where you can give it a title and start adding content. Use the back button to return to your wiki.
----
You can also make many pages at once. Type out all the pages you'd like to make as text (each on their own line). Then highlight them all, click the⋮⋮icon that appears on hover, clickTurn Intoand selectPage.
All these sub-pages make navigating your wiki intuitive. No more wasting time with ghost hunts through document graveyards. No more switching tabs between the info you need to get the job done. Everything starts at your wiki.
Now, time to organize it.
Add some personality to your pages
Click to expand
Now that your information is collected in a series of pages, you can add more organizational elements to make everything easier to find.
----
Of course, this is beneficial to your PMs — the people in and out of your wiki every day. But a structured wiki is also helpful for someone on the community team who wants to see how many times a feature has been requested. Maybe an engineer will want to check on the product pipeline, using the roadmap page inside your wiki. Instead of asking you these questions, other team members can quickly uncover the answers themselves.
There are several features in Notion to help you customize your wiki to match your workflow.
----
Headers are the way to go. Using the slash command, type/headingto see your options:H1(the largest),H2, orH3(the smallest). Once you have them, you can use the drag-and-drop feature to organize all the pages in your workspace and put them where they need to go.
We've found columns are a neat way to organize pages. Use the drag-and-drop feature to create columns by grabbing the⋮⋮icon next to your header and pulling it all the way to the right. The blue guides will help.
You can even add divider lines under your headers for a polished look by typing three hyphens in a row underneath.
Once that's all set up, use⋮⋮again to grab pages and drag them into the sections where they belong.
----
A category like "Team” might contain pages for your goals and a team directory. A category like “User Research” might have pages for processes and a database of conversations you’ve had with customers. “Projects” probably includes pages for your roadmap and product ideation.
As your team grows, Notion grows with you.
Easily add new pages to your wiki or change information, like when you need to update your process for launching a new feature.
----
Not only does Notion grow with you — but it also helps your team grow. Instead of walking your new PM through every piece of tech, every process and every guide (which are inevitably scattered across different software), give them the keys to your product wiki. They can explore the nooks and crannies of your organization and revisit this information whenever they need.
With living, breathing documentation of your team’s work, onboarding isn’t a one-way street. It’s an active conversation that’s customized to every new employee.
----
Product managers are often charged with centralizing many different types of content across many different tools. They need to create specs, keep tabs on designs and prototypes, understand the codebase, offer feedback across multiple media, and keep everyone informed about what each other is working on.
With embeds and integrations, Notion can be the hub that connects all of these disparate sources of information, no matter where they live. This means that pages on your product wiki can be home to:
Figma files— so you can view and instantly jump to design concepts
Github gists— to easily share code snippets and data
Images & videos— to centralize inspiration, past work, whiteboard photos, etc.
----
Loom recordings— to quickly and visually explain something to the team
Typeform surveys— to capture information from your team right in Notion
Code blocks— to document code for quick reference and reuse
PDFs— to store contracts, agreements, and more right with the work
This flexibility allows product managers to collect all the different parts of a project in a single place. Teams use different tools. Notion brings them together.
Sometimes, information is best displayed in a table. Databases can be good tools for collecting and structuring helpful data for your team, like user feedback, research, meeting notes and more.
----
Notion makes it possible for all of this to live directly in your wiki. That way, knowledge informs your work and vice versa.
There are few different types of databases you can build in Notion: aTable,Board,Gallery,List, orCalendar. We'll be focusing on theTablehere, which, for example, you can use to catalog user research sessions where you've collected notes.
----
In this setup, every row is a user research session. Your notes are in the first column underName, and the other columns are properties of that session — like the task that was observed, the date of the session, its status, and who on the team conducted the session. You can open any individual session as its own Notion page, which can be structured however you want to capture what you learn.
Here's how this could look (also showing how you can view the same information as a board):
To add this type of database to your product wiki:
Add a sub-page, chooseTablefrom the list of options, and title it "User Research Database."
----
Customize your properties by clicking on each column header. This lets you choose what type of property you want to use, and also give it a name. For instance, the "Task" property above is a single select property that allows you to choose from a menu of tags you define. The "Interviewer" property is a person property that lets you tag your team members.
To view the information in your table as a board, click+ Add a viewat the top left. SelectBoardand give it a name.
----
You can also filter and sort the information in your table by using those buttons at the top right. You'll be prompted to choose which property you want to filter by. For example, let's say you only wanted to see user research sessions conducted by Doug. You can also create filtered views. First, add a new view, then apply a filter. You'll be able to toggle between this subset of data and your full table in an instant.
In Notion, your wiki becomes a multitool.
----
It can house everything PMs need, from seminal documents to recent A/B test data to interviews with customers. This information — normally dispersed and inaccessible — now works together to improve your product. It also connects your team. They learn as one. It’s the campfire that draws in your product team after journeys with different projects.
If people have questions about anything on your wiki, they can comment or ask directly in Notion.
You can also tag anyone else in the organization to enable better cross-team collaboration, communication and transparency. They'll be notified immediately that you need something or that they should take ownership of something.
----
With these collaboration tools, you and your team can hold ongoing, asynchronous conversations across teams and timezones.
Maybe you notice that the process for tagging product feedback can be improved. In your process doc, you can start a conversation with another teammate. Here’s how:
In a page, hover over the page's title. There, you'll see a button forAdd discussion. This is like a forum at the top of any page where you can discuss its contents.
You can also highlight any text to see the option to comment, or use the shortcutcmd/ctrl+shift+mto comment on anything.
To mention a teammate, simply type@and start typing their name to pull them up.
----
You can hover over any block and comment that way, too. On the left, hit⋮⋮to get the full menu of options. SelectComment. The comment will then appear on the right of the block.
Comments bring discourse to the forefront. Anyone might be able to learn from the conversation being had or chime in. Maybe someone has an idea that’s better than yours. Notion makes all this discourse visible and easy to respond to at any point. You don't have to worry about missing messages or needing to remember that one thing someone told you yesterday.
Especially when working remotely, Notion can make your team feel present together in their work, and make sure ideas, questions, and thoughts don't get lost in the hustle.
----
Visual learner? We created a 7-minute video showing how to build a wiki:
Your product team's wiki can be a unifying force.
Processes, guidelines, philosophies, goals and more all live here so your team can focus on taking consistent standards into the cross-functional to produce great things.
As your team grows, a central place for communication and collaboration keeps your product moving forward and constantly improving.
We hope this helps you along the way.

How to create new pages as you type
In Notion, you can create new pages as you type without breaking your writing flow.
As you’re writing a sentence, click the@key, then type the words that will make up the title of the page.
You’ll have the option to either nest that new page in the page where you are writing, or store it somewhere else in your workspace.
For example, you could come up with a new task in your to-do list, and seamlessly add it to your Tasks database.
To access your new page, click on the link you created.
This simple trick helps you structure your workspace without interrupting your train of thought.

How to create OKRs
OKRs (objectives and key results) are a framework for setting goals and keeping track of their progress.
Notion’s versatility can help you carry out all the planning and tracking of these OKRs.
Plus, when goals are all in one place, this creates transparency across your entire company.
This video shows you how to build an OKR database from scratch, and add different database views for each team or quarter.
You can assign specific key results, timelines, or owners to each objective.
You can neatly link your OKR database in other Notion pages for easy access and updates.

How to join your team that’s using Notion
This video provides new users with a tour of a team workspace on Notion.
The sidebar holds teamspaces with top-level pages, which are the highest-level homes for information.
Top-level pages boast sub-pages, where teams can store all the information they want.
Every Notion page is composed of content blocks, which could be text, callout blocks, videos, or embeds.
Notion databases are highly customizable, and can store complex information that can be displayed in different ways.
Notion is a place where things get done. You can tag team members in comments or in the body of a page for specific feedback.
----
When someone mentions you in a workspace, you'll be notified in yourInbox, located towards the top of your sidebar.
Not all pages in a team's workspace are shared with everyone, as specific sharing settings may be applied to pages.
You can use theQuick Findfunctionality to find a particular doc or database, as well as ourQ&Afeature, powered by AI.
Your sidebar just got better
While the information presented in this guide is still useful, some elements of the sidebar have been updated — making sharing with the right groups easier. Learn about howteamspaces give every team a home for their important work.

To get your Notion workspace up and running, start at thesidebar. This is where your company’s projects and information live, so keeping it clean, clear, and organized makes finding and using information easier. If info is inaccessible, it might as well not exist.
You'll first want to set your teamspaces and information architecture, which occupy theTeamspacessection in your sidebar.
Think of these as homepages at your company, acting as the broadest level of categorization possible.
Create teamspaces for your main departments, like one for marketing and another for engineering.
Use the default “General” teamspace for pages you want everyone to be able to access — like meeting notes, docs, mission, and values.
----
Then, start adding pages to your teamspaces. The fastest way to get these top-level pages started is using Notion’s templates.Duplicate and add any of our templates
into your team’s workspace.
To manually add new top-level pages from scratch to your teamspaces, click+to the immediate right. A blank page will appear giving you the option to either create a database, empty page, import information, or work off an existing template.
----
But maybe you don't want teammates changing top-level pages in teamspaces. In theTeamspace settingssection in your sidebar, findSecurity.Once there, you'll be able to toggle off the ability for teammates to edit the sidebar. However, this feature is only available onEnterpriseplans and you must be an admin to activate it.
After your sidebar has been locked, this helps reinforce the keeping of relevantnested pageswithin your top-level pages. For example, your top-level company home page might have nested pages for benefits info or how to request PTO. Having these as sub-pages keeps the information organized and easily accessible.
----
Don't forget — teams can also customize their pages. From headers and columns, to Figma files and code snippets, each team wiki can be tailored to the work at hand. Learnwriting and editingbasics, then tacklestyles and customization.

Once your initial top-pages are up,invite your teamto the workspace. In the sidebar, clickSettings & Members. UnderWorkspace, selectMembers. Tap theAdd membersbutton. Enter their email address.
Before inviting teammates, you’ll have the option to set each person you invite into your workspace as:
Member— can't change workspace settings or invite new members into the workspace.
----
Membership admin— can invite new members to the workspace and edit groups but can’t change workspace settings.
Workspace owner— can change workspace settings and invite new members to the workspace.
Then clickInvite.
If you want to add teammates even faster, in theSettings & Memberssection of your sidebar, you can:
Allow everyone with your company's email domain to automatically join your workspace. Do this underAllowed email domains.
Invite teammates en masse via a secret link, where they can automatically join when clicking on that link you send via an email or Slack message.

Whether it’s the engineering team’s tasks or the company-wide roadmap, Notion databases are essential for running projects and executing them with speed and precision. We suggest creating shared databases (as top-level pages) for:
Projects / Roadmap
Meeting Notes
Docs
----
For any shared documentation, whenever possible, use one big database. Why?
Because properties, filters, views, and more allow your team to slice information however they need. Having one big database fosters important company-wide transparency and learning, while individuals can customize what information they see and how they see it.
Here are a few more tips for getting the most out of your team's databases.
Templates help ensure you’re running processes consistently. And as your team grows, they’re important for scaling those processes.
----
You can create any number of customized templates that spin up immediately, containing questions, prompts, or edge-cases. Because templates are so customizable, if your team learns something about how a project was done, the template can be updated. This promotes learnings across your team and takes those learnings forward into everything you do.
For your different databases, you might include:
Templates for different types of meeting notes— from 1:1s to standups, have everything in your template ready so the meeting can get under way. We’ve created some meeting notes templates you can use to get started, including some for remote teams (includingstandupsandall-handsmeetings) and for1:1s.
----
Templates for recurring projects— you may need to regularly drum up more support articles or complete user research sessions. Make sure each project starts with the same criteria so you can execute consistently. Some of our pre-made templates for this work includes aproduct specand adesign spec.
Pages comprise Notion databases. And inside pages is where the work actually happens. But you need a way to spell out key facts around your team's work.
We have a whole Guide abouthow to use database properties and when to use them. Of course, they should be customized to your team's needs, based on your work and your processes.

Database views are also customizable, helping you and your team surface relevant information your database.
Let's say you have a company-wide roadmap. Want to see all projects organized by status? Create a view for it. Want to see a table organized by project priority? You can make a view for that too. What about a calendar of all the launch dates? Yep, you can create a view for that.

How workspace owners can set up teamspaces for their organization
Teamspaces give you more customizability and control over access levels to content, functioning like smaller workspaces within your workspace. Everyone at your company will be able to join teamspaces that are relevant to their role, and structure their sidebar to best fit their individual working needs. As an admin, you’ll have some additional security and provisioning settings to consider that can be customized with each teamspace.
----
If you previously operated in a workspace without teamspaces, here’s what to expect when the feature is turned on for you. All pages in the workspace section will become pages in a “general” teamspace and you’ll be free to move and create additional teamspaces as you see fit. In this guide we’ll discuss why and how to create new teamspaces.
The first decision you will have to make as a workspace owner is who should be able to create teamspaces. By default, any members in your workspace (not guests) can create new teamspaces. You can change this setting with the “Limit teamspace creation to only workspace owners” toggle. Toggling this option won’t affect any existing teamspaces.
----
Depending on how your organization approaches content management and provisioning, you may have different considerations for whether or not to allow members to create teamspaces.
Here’s some general rules for when to allow all members create teamspaces (keep the default):
You prefer to let your employees move nimbly and set up their own structures
Limiting teamspace creation to only workspace owners would create a bottleneck in your workflows
However, you may consider limiting teamspace creation to workspace owners if any of the following apply to you:
You want more oversight over changes in your Notion instance
You want to have a centralized plan for teamspaces
----
You can find settings and more information in Settings & Members, under the tabTeamspaces. Here, you’ll be able to see and update which teamspaces are the default for new members to join. We recommend only having 1-3 teamspaces as default — only content that is truly necessary for every employee at your company. As you create more teamspaces, this is where you will be able to see a list of information about each of them.
----
Teamspaces create a new layer of access to provision content to individual members of your workspace. They let you be more specific about who from your organization is able to access content in Notion, and with what level of permission. Each teamspace has a list of members and at least one owner, and you can set permission levels to content on a per-teamspace basis.
----
This will look different in each workspace, but here’s an example. If you create a Marketing teamspace, you can give all members of the teamspaceCan Editaccess, and give all other members of the workspaceCan Viewaccess. By default, teamspace owners haveFull Accessto all content within the teamspace. Now any content you add to the Marketing teamspace will inherit these permission settings, with no further action needed on your part.
Teamspaces can help answer some of these questions you might have come across previously as a Notion admin. Here’s a few instances where granular permissions might make sense for your organization.
----
Automatically provision content for new hires— Once configured, SCIM will let you automatically add new hires to the relevant teamspaces via groups, making it easy for them to find the content they need on day one.
Decrease “shared page” clutter —Some work is too sensitive to be shared broadly, resulting in a messy shared section of one-off pages. A closed or private teamspace with the relevant stakeholders is a good way to keep a boundary around sensitive content while maintaining organizational structure.
----
Increase view-only access to important company information— When your tools are too siloed, it’s impossible to find the information you need from a different team. Converting team working documents with varied permission levels into open teamspaces allows everyone to search for and view the content, while giving editors and managers the level of freedom they need.
Prevent accidental permissions changes— One teamspace might allow members to create public pages, while another doesn’t. This prevents sensitive information from accidentally being switched to public, while keeping it visible to your whole org.

----
If your workspace is on the Enterprise plan, you can configure custom settings for public page sharing, allowing guests, and allowing exports within each teamspace. By default, each teamspace will match the corresponding setting toggles at the workspace level. If you would like to override a workspace setting for a teamspace, only workspace owners have that ability.
At the teamspace level, you can see “Disable guests” and “Disable export” are matching their corresponding toggles at the workspace level. Their help text readsBased on workspace settings. In contrast, “Disable public page sharing” has help text readingOverriding workspace settingsand you can see it does not match the workspace level toggle.
----
Once you understand the new security settings, you’re ready to set up teamspaces for your company!
If you already have top-level pages for functional areas, office locations, or employee resource groups, that’s a great place to start. You can turn each of those top-level pages into a teamspace. Just hover over the page in the sidebar and click on the … icon and you’ll see a new option:Turn into teamspace. Note that full-page databases, or pages from within databases, cannot be turned into teamspaces.
Curious which types of pages make good teamspaces?
Click to expand
----
Once you’ve created the teamspace, it’s time to move relevant content into it. You can still drag pages into teamspaces, or you can use theMove tomenu. Click on the•••icon next to any page in the sidebar and chooseMove to. In the pop-up menu, you’ll see the names of teamspaces listed as destinations. Note that you have to haveFull accessto a page in order to move it.
Now that you have your teamspaces, let’s make sure they have the right people as part of them. Plus, you’ll be able to automatically provision the right content to the right people by using SCIM in combination with teamspaces.
----
The best way to manage the membership lists of your teamspaces is by using permission groups. You can configure these natively in Notion underSettings & Members, in theMemberstab. If you’re on an Enterprise plan, we highly recommend using SCIM and any groups that you have already configured in your identity provider. Once a teamspace is created, you can add an entire permission group to it. That’s it!
Need to set up SCIM in your Notion workspace?
Click to expand
Before you add a group to a teamspace, make sure to check in with the leader of that team or group. They’ll need to know that their content will be moving to a teamspace, and you’ll want to make sure that they are assigned aTeam Ownerrole.
----
If you are using SCIM to control your groups, you’ll have a few additional steps to ensure that your groups are always up-to-date with your latest hires.
Review the groups that you have set up in your identity provider. Determine which groups should be added to which teamspaces.
If you have ideas for lots of teamspaces without clearly defined groups in your identity provider, take a second pass through and determine if all of that segmentation is necessary.
Add new employees to the relevant group in your identity provider, and they will be automatically added to the corresponding teamspaces in Notion.
Ready for teamspaces? Here’s a checklist you can use to help your rollout be as smooth as possible:
----
Revisit your workspace settings to ensure that exporting, guests, and public page sharing are set how you want them
Revisit your member list to ensure that your workspace owners are accurate
Decide whether you want all members or only workspace owners to be able to create new teamspaces
Decide which pages will be converted into teamspaces, and what other content will be moved to those new teamspaces
RequestFull Accessto any pages you might need to move as part of this process
Determine if you will have any closed or private teamspaces
Communicate with any new teamspace owners about the changes that will be coming to the workspace
Check to make sure you have a current SCIM API token and that your SCIM configuration is working properly

Import projects from Asana for a connected work experience
Specialist project management tools like Asana often force your team to follow a rigid process, and because you need additional tools to complete your work, you’re constantly switching apps.
In Notion, you can build a powerful project management solution that’s seamlessly integrated with your docs, notes, and knowledge base – with AI integrated throughout.
----
Instead of jumping from tool to tool, Notion enables the full project workflow – from ideation to execution. Now you’ll knowwho is doing what and whencoupled with documentation and knowledge to know thehow and whybehind every task. You also have Notion AI to help you draft briefs, find action items, summarize tasks and docs, write updates, and more.
In this guide, you’ll learn how to:
Import your projects and tasks from Asana to Notion in just a few clicks.
Translate Asana functionality into Notion
Build a customizable, AI-powered project management system that connects to the rest of your work
Our Asana importer provides a convenient, straightforward way to migrate your projects and tasks to Notion without losing any of your work.
----
To get started:
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Import→Asana. Alternatively, use the/command/asanain a page and select the option underImport.
Sign into Asana and grant the requested permissions.
UnderChoose Asana workspace, select the Asana workspace you want to import.
Select the projects you’d like to import.
Select the Notion teamspace your projects should be imported into. Each Asana team will be imported into one Notion teamspace.
You can check the box next to your workspace name toExclude completed projectsorSelect all projects.
SelectNext.
----
By default, all Asana task properties will be imported into Notion, but you can customize this per teamspace. Choose toSelect all properties(the default setting) orCustomize properties. Note that there are default properties that must be imported.
Choose whether theStatusproperty in Notion should be mapped to yourSectionorCompletedproperty in Asana.
SelectImport.
What to expect when you import from Asana to Notion
Learn more about how importing from Asana to Notion workshere.
Importing from Asana vs. syncing Asana with Notion
Importing your Asana data into Notion is best if you want to move from Asana and use Notion as the primary tool for your work. The data will be duplicated into Notion, but not synchronized with Asana.
----
Synced databasesallow you to connect Asana to Notion without importing any data. You might prefer to use synced databases if you use both Asana and Notion for your work. Synced databases only go one direction, meaning that changes will need to happen in Asana in order for updates to reflect in Notion.
To add a synced database from Asana, simply paste a project link right into a Notion page.Learn more about synced databases here →
As you import, you'll chose which fields associated with your projects and tasks you want to bring over to Notion, (such as due dates, assignees, attachments, etc). These will migrate over to Notion asdatabase properties.
----
Your Asana teams will becometeamspacesin Notion — sub-sections of your company workspace containing each team’s content.
If your organization is small, you might want to keep all your projects and tasks in one generic teamspace. Larger companies can create a company-wide teamspace for things like docs and meeting notes, plus teamspaces for departments like marketing, sales, product, etc. Each team can have their own projects and tasks databases in their teamspace.
Asana teams become teamspaces in Notion
Learn how to use teamspaceshere.
Notion offers a lot of the same features as Asana, and more. For the features that don’t come built-in, Notion’s code-free building blocks can help you recreate their functionality.
----
Here are some examples of how to adapt your Asana workflows to Notion.
Your Asana projects and tasks get imported into specialized databases calledProjects and Tasksin Notion. These two databases are purpose-built for project management and have many helpful properties to help you organize your workload.
Projects and Tasks are connected, so when you add new tasks you can relate them to their associated project. You’ll also be able to view those tasks on your projects database, sort tasks by project, visualize project completion percentage and more.
This is all enabled by aRelationproperty. You’ll see separate areas for Projects and Tasks, and they’re in sync with one another.
----
Anysub-tasks or dependenciesyou have in Asana will also map over to your Notion Projects and Tasks. This helps you get granular about task management, break larger tasks into small steps and understand when one task is blocking another.
Once they’re imported from Asana into Notion, projects and tasks each contain several views so you can see and track your work in many ways. You can learn more about these default viewshere.You can also add new, customdatabase viewsby clicking on+next to the existing database views.
----
Any of these views can be filtered to show subsets of information. To filter your projects and tasks databases, click “Filter” then choose the property you want to filter by. You could have filtered views to show all projects that are currently “In progress” or tasks assigned to you.
Use theSortmenu to rearrange database items, for example to put tasks in order of due date. Additionally, and click on the options menu…to group items according to different characteristics, so you can group tasks by their related project.
All about databases
Learn more about using databases in Notionhere.
Here are some ways to recreate certain Asana features that don’t come built-in with Notion.
----
Task reviews & feedback— Asana lets you request and give approval on assets and tasks. If your task or project needs approval, use aPersonproperty to tag whoever needs to sign off, or add an additionalStatusproperty to indicate whether approval has been granted. Alternatively, create a sub-task for collecting feedback, which will become a separate item in your database.
Forms—You can’t create forms natively in Notion, however it’s possible to embed a Typeform into a Notion page, or integrate Typeform with Notion to automatically sync survey responses to a Notion database.
----
Time tracking and workload mapping— In Asana, you can estimate the required time for a particular task, and track time spent working on those tasks. In Notion, use the suggestedEstimatesproperty to score expected time required using a points system. You can also use aFormulaproperty to calculate how much time your team spends on different tasks and projects. First, add “task start” and “task complete” date properties to your projects. Then, create a formula property and paste in the following formula:dateBetween(prop("End time"), prop("Start time"), "hours")
----
Rules and workflows —Instead of Asana’s workflows, create customButtonsto complete multiple steps in one click, like adding a new task, assigning it to a team member and giving it a status. If your team works in sprints, learn about sprint automationshere.
Goals and milestones— You can track milestones in Notion by adding them as tasks. Then create a checkbox property, name it milestone, and select any tasks that are milestones. If you want to review all milestones, create a view that filters for milestones. To create goals and link them to your projects and tasks, copy the OKR and goal setting templates from the template gallery into your workspace.
----
Reporting and dashboards— Notion doesn’t support reporting and dashboards, but you can use filtered views to organize information by different properties. ARollupproperty in your projects database can display the percentage of completed tasks as a progress bar.
Project management is just one piece of your Notion workspace. Build anything with code-free blocks, consolidate your work and get more done with Notion AI.
Your project status will map over from Asana as a multi-select property in Notion.
For more targeted tracking, you can change this to aStatusproperty by clicking on the property, selectingEdit property, and changing the type toStatus.
----
Notion’s Status property has three main categories:To do,In progress, andDone. Within each of these, create more specific sub-categories likeTo be reviewedorEditing. This helps you give managers and team members a more concrete view of task and project progress and provides clarity on what should happen next.
Using the Status property, you could
Filter your database to show all projects in flight— Click onFilterand select the Status property. Then, check off theIn progresscategory to show only ongoing projects in this database view.
Drag and drop to update project status— When you’re in a Board view grouped by Status, move your project along by simply dragging and dropping it into the next column.
----
Build a custom workflow for each team— Add as many sub-categories to each Status group as you need. Teams can have their own set of Status tags according to the work they do. So, your marketing team might have Status tags that relate to drafting, editing, and publishing content, while Statuses for product teams could indicate whether a feature is in development or ready to launch.
Instead of a project page that links to other tools, teams can get on with work right inside a project page.
You can add all kinds of blocks to Notion pages - headings, text, images, bullet points, checklists, videos, and more, embed content from other tools, and create tables and linked versions of other databases inside a page.
----
Standardize your project briefs and processes using templates— To add a database template, go to the dropdown next toNewand selectNew template. Name the template “Project brief” and customize the page with any headings you need to include. Whenever you need a new project brief, you can create a database entry from the template and fill up the information.
Draft project briefs in seconds with Notion AI— Instead of spending valuable time writing project briefs yourself, you can ask Notion AI to help draft project outlines. Hit the spacebar to open Notion AI and ask for help writing a project brief.
----
Embed content from specialist tools— Notion integrates with many external tools, including Figma, Miro, Github, Jira, and more. You can embed content from those tools into your project pages to facilitate cross-functional collaboration on projects that includes design teams, engineers, and more.
Migrating your projects and tasks into Notion will cut down the number of different tools you require.
Notion’sRelationproperty lets you link one database to another, meaning you can connect projects with tasks, supporting documentation, relevant meeting notes, and even your quarterly goals.
----
To add a Relation property, go toProperties,+ Add a new property, then selectRelation. Then, choose the database you want to link - for example, Tasks. Toggle onShow on tasksto make the relation visible on both databases.
Once tasks and projects are related, you’ll be able to link daily work to larger initiatives.
Assign tasks to corresponding projects— Each project can be made up of a series of tasks, so you can assign tasks to different team members and ensure daily work contributes to progress on projects.
----
Motivate your team with visual progress bars— View project completion percentage as a progress bar or ring. To do this, add aRollupproperty and select your related “Tasks” database. Then, selectPercent per groupandComplete. This will calculate the amount of completed tasks per project and display the result in a visual format.
Attach relevant meeting notes or documents to projects— As well as connecting Tasks and Projects, you can add more relation properties to link docs and meeting notes as well. This means you’ll have easy access to relevant notes and docs straight from your project page.
----
Streamline work with sprints—When you add the suggested “Sprints” property to your tasks database, you’ll be able to organize your tasks by sprint, and take advantage of custom sprint planning views and automations. Learn morehere.
With meeting notes, docs, projects, and tasks all connected, everyone has the necessary context behind their work. Key information is easy to find, as it’s only a click away from the project page.
Notion AI can help you write, edit and create new ideas all without leaving your workspace.
With this powerful, built-in AI tool, you can get more quality work done in a fraction of the time it used to take.
----
Write project briefs and docs in minutes— Turn a few bulleted ideas into a fully-fledged project brief in a matter of minutes. From there, you can ask AI to extract action items and then start adding tasks to your to-do list.
Summarize every project and task— With AI autofill you can automatically extract project summaries for high level digest of your team’s happenings, no extra work required.
Extract insights from tasks— Use a custom AI prompt in your tasks database to identify blockers or risks noted on the page and always stay one step ahead.
Brainstorm new feature ideas— If you need inspiration, use Notion AI as a thinking partner to brainstorm endless feature ideas for your product.

Intro to Timeline view
Timeline views in Notion help display projects chronologically.
You can create a timeline view from scratch, or add one to an already existing database.
To save time, consider starting with a template. Find one in our template picker, or directly from theNotion Template Gallery.
Since timeline views display entries according to their dates, they require at least one date property in the database.
Just like for any Notion database, you can adjust a timeline’s layout from its menu. You may also decide to group entries according to one of their properties.
Try adding sub-items to your timeline, allowing for more detailed project breakdowns.

Add dependencies to connect database entries, visually representing how different projects or project phases depend on each other.
Notion timelines are way more than a Gantt chart. They give you complete flexibility to scope projects, adjust their dates, customize your workflow, and actually get work done inside their pages.

Build a journal in Notion
With the help of Notion, you can make journaling part of your life.
Start by creating a database for all your journal entries.
Then, neatly store all of your entries together for future reading and review.
You can add text, images, or even videos inside your journal pages.
Plus, add any properties you want, like tags and dates.
You can filter and sort your entries as you please. For the latter, you may sort your content from most recent to oldest.
Inside your pages, you can drag and drop any content until you like what you see. And you can always change your mind later if you want to use a regular page instead of a database.

Make work more efficient with database button properties
Tracking progress on your work can be tedious, and some processes, like signing off a project, approving a document, or escalating a task, might require a few steps and changing several properties in Notion.
With database buttons, you can trigger a series of actions for any database entry with one click, which saves you time, reduces the margin for error, and makes it easier for everyone on your team to complete the required steps.
----
Database buttons are one of three types of automations you can build in your Notion workspace, along with database automations and button blocks. In this guide, we’ll explain how to create and use database buttons, and also when to use each type of automation.
Database buttons are a database property you can add to any database. They will appear as a property, and each line item will have its own button.
To create a database button:
In your database’s properties menu, select + New property
Choose Button as the property type.
Type a Property Name and Label (for example, “Sign off project”) for your Button to indicate what the button will do. This will appear in the database as the property title and in each row.
----
Click Add a step to start configuring the button actions.
Buttons can contain several steps or actions that will all take place when the button is clicked. A button can update properties and add or edit pages in any database you choose.
These are all the different action steps you can add to a database button can take:
SelectingAdd page to…will create a new page in a database — this can be the current database you’re working in or any other database you have access to.
After choosing the database, you can select an existing template from that database or give the new entry a name. ClickEdit another propertyto continue filling out more properties in the new item.
----
Now, when you click the button, a page will be created in the database of your choice, with some properties already completed as specified.
TheEdit pages in…option will edit the properties of specified pages in a database.
ChooseThis pageto edit the current page, or, if your button already has anAdd a new pagestep, you can selectNew pageto edit it. Alternatively, choose a database and edit a subset of pages in it by creating a filter.
After this, selectEdit a propertyto choose properties and configure how you want to update them.
Confirmation dialogs can be helpful when clicking a button triggers a workflow for other teams or colleagues.
----
When you addShow confirmationto your button, the confirmation box will appear to everyone who clicks, providing a safeguard in case someone clicks accidentally.
You can customize the confirmation dialog text to say something like “Are you sure you want to continue?” and also edit the two options a person can click to either stop or continue.
If you want a particular page to open when you click a button, selectOpen page.
This can be:
The brand new page created in a previousAdd page to…step
A page edited as part of the automation sequence
Any other page in the workspace
Database buttons are powerful because they give everyone the ability to trigger a sequence of actions by simply clicking the button.
----
Instead of having to manually follow each step, a whole workflow can be condensed into one action.
Here are some examples of effective ways to use database buttons.
Project managers can complete all the necessary steps to sign off on a project simply by clicking theApprovebutton.

Then, customize your button with these steps:
SelectEdit pages in…, and chooseThis page. In theEdit a propertydropdown, change theStatustoDone.
ClickEdit another propertyand fill out the Completed date with Now (this will always show the date the button was clicked)
ClickEdit another property, chooseApproved byand selectPerson who clicked the button.
----
A similar process could be used to approve documents or wiki pages once all edits have been finalized.
Or, if a document needs approval from a specific team, such as legal, you can create a button that tags someone from the legal team, marks legal status asPending, and sets an approval deadline for a week from today.
Sometimes, a task or engineering issue requires intervention from a manager to get resolved.
Create anEscalatebutton in your database to allow team members to escalate tasks in one click.
Properties for an "Escalate" button
Click to expand
To create theEscalatebutton:
Update theOwnerproperty to tag your team leader.
Change the priority status to🔥High
Add a confirmation dialog to continue or cancel.
----
An upvote database allows team members to vote on different options in a database, such as topics to discuss at the next all-hands, or new feature suggestions.
What you’ll need for an "Upvote" button
Click to expand
To edit your Upvote button, simplyEdit the current pageto tag thePerson who clicked the buttonin theUpvoted bycolumn, and the formula will calculate the total number of upvotes.
Upvoting can also be used in your personal Notion space to share ideas and get feedback from friends or family.
Simplify expense tracking— Use buttons to categorize expenses or assign budgets. For example, the button could tag a specific budget from your budgets database and be marked asAssigned.
----
Keep a habit log— Record your habits in a database and track your achievements and streaks over time. YourCompletebutton could tick theDonecheckbox for all columns.
Tag content in a wiki— Tag and categorize wiki pages for quick retrieval. Using a button, you can add a category to your page and mark it asVerified.
Mark items as duplicate— Allow team members to easily flag duplicate items they discover in a database. TheMark as duplicatebutton might add aDuplicatetag and change the status toArchived.
There are three different ways to use automation across your Notion workspace.
----
Database buttons allow you to add items to databases and edit several properties simultaneously. Teams can use button properties for smoother project management workflow and to save time on administrative manual work.
You can also create Button blocks on individual pages, and database automations for different sorts of work.
Add a button to any Notion page by opening the / menu and selectingButton.
Buttons live on pages and can create blocks on the current page. They can also edit some properties of database pages or add new pages to a database, making them useful for editing items without needing to navigate to the database itself.
Use button blocks to:
Generate pages in databases, such as task-creation workflows.
----
Edit all items in a database, for example, to assign overdue tasks to you.
Instantly generate checklists or outlines for meetings or project briefs.
All about buttons
Click to expand
Database automations are for actions taking place behind the scenes.
Unlike buttons, they don’t require any clicking. They share some functionality with database buttons, but property updates trigger the actions.
Database automations also allow you to send slack messages.Actions can include adding or editing pages in a database, and sending Slack notifications to team members or channels.
Use database automations to:
Assign a task to someone automatically when the task status changes.
Send a Slack notification when a new page is added.
----
Edit a page property in another database when a property is changed.
If you want to stop a database automation, it has to be paused or deleted.

Use link previews to collaborate, manage projects, and ship faster
Different teams use different tools to get work done. But what happens when it’s time to collaborate?
Feedback lives here. Task statuses live there. Soon, it feels like you’re panning for gold, sifting for that nugget of information you need to get context, push a project forward, or make a decision.
People already bring information from other tools into Notion simply by sharing links. But with the newest addition to our line of API features —link previews— you can get live updates from those other tools right in Notion. This enables you to build workflows leveraging the up-to-date information teams need for cross-functional collaboration.
----
Here are a few ways to use link previews to bring full transparency to manage work between teams.
All you have to do is paste a link from Jira, Slack, Asana, Trello, and GitHub, and a preview is generated with real-time information fetched directly from the link. Here’s what it means for you:
Log in once— if a Notion page is shared with you, link previews let you view information from other tools after that initial log-in.
Display updated information from other tools— the links are updated on a continuous basis, so there’s no additional work you need to do to update the information.
----
Build a granular project management system— unite all aspects of your project into a single project management system, so you’re not chasing around disparate pieces of valuable information. Say, adding tasks from Jira to your project tracking page in Notion so everyone can see the status of tasks in one place. Or adding Slack updates into that same page so you have asingle source of truth.
Bring teams working on other tools on one page, literally— link previews doesn’t just gathers tasks, notes, and updates from other tools. It also brings teams together on a single Notion page, where they can paste external links, share information and collaborate without switching tools during an ongoing project.
----
When you'reworking cross-functionally, both tools and people come together. But often, there isn’t a place to collaborate, meaning information gets lost. Notion’s API helps you build custom workflows that match project needs, but that’s even more powerful with link previews — the information teams need to execute lives in one place, even when folks are using different tools.
Here are a few ways you can use link previews to help your team execute.
We know that many engineering teams use tools like Jira and Asana to manage their product roadmap, track bugs, see their backlog, create reports, and more.
----
But other teams outside engineering often don’t have insight into these statuses. Instead, they’re left to send Slack messages or emails, asking engineers if the work is complete.If you’re using a page in Notion to track the status of bug fixes and product updates for a project , ask your engineering team to post Jira link previews inside the page so other teams know exactly when issues are fixed.
This makes information more accessible to all, helping align teams without meetings, pings, or rooting around.
For example, your marketing team can release a tweet that a critical bug has been fixed without needing to ask engineers its status. Or the sales team can let prospects know about new features as soon as they land.
----
A team launching a new product needs to be able to track all the dependencies that go into that final product. For example, you need to build a feature for creating events before your calendaring app is launch-ready.
It’s important to be able to navigate constant change against a tight timeline.
Using Notion’s link previews, product teams can get everyone up to speed without needing to go into tools like GitHub. Simply paste GitHub links inside Notion pages where engineers are tracking feature statuses. That way, new tasks can be started as soon as dependencies are completed, helping your team move quicker.
Swirling conversations about work can be difficult to keep track of, especially when that information lives in different tools.
----
Using link previews, you can paste a Slack message right into a Notion page — so you have direct access to information (minus the noise) while still in focus mode. For example, when your content team is writing a new blog post, they can get access to relevant Slack messages about that post without being distracted by all the other messages flying around your channels.
Working with external collaborators can bring a few speed bumps to your process. How many times have you shared a doc without giving the right person access?
Link previews gives external collaborators all the information they need to execute, uniting teams without needing to manage more access controls.
----
If you’re working with external teams, they’re probably not all using the same project management software. So instead of granting access to entire tools or systems, simply paste links from other tools like Trello and Asana right in Notion so everyone’s aligned on statuses and action items.
Notion helps you bring tools, teams, and workflows into a single source of truth.
Normally, updates would be buried under these tools — but link previews ensures you have live information (and full clarity) to execute. Link previews are now supported for Jira, Slack, Asana, Trello, and GitHub.

How managers get a clear view of what everyone’s working on in Notion
Managers' plates often look like they’re at a buffet — extremely full. Instead of food, it's many types of work, the people executing it, and balancing all the timelines to keep everything moving. This is even more difficult when teams use different tools to do their jobs.
Most project management apps just point to the work, meaning you’re always switching between different tabs and tools. But in Notion, you can unite project management with the work itself, along with the people and communication to get that work done.
----
We’ll show you how to set up a system so you and your team can spend less time going back and forth to find information, and more time getting down to important work. You’ll have total visibility into what’s going on, what stage projects are at, and each team member’s current workload.
In the first section of this guide, we’ll look at some of the different ways you can use Notion to coordinate your team’s work.
Time is everyone’s most valuable resource, so set your team up to use it wisely. Make information easily accessible, so teammates aren’t listlessly digging around outdated documentation or disrupting the flow state of a colleague to ask where something is.
----
Create a top-level homepage, orcompany wiki, where all employees can access shared information like the benefits policy, the mission, vision and values, and company goals. With things likeheaders, columns, and more, you can make information quickly accessible at a glance.
Then, each department or team should have its own, top-level homepage in the sidebar.
Team hubs are important for finding and using info — further cementing this self-service mentality where team members can find what they need without always having to ask their manager. Plus, it enables teams to customize their homepages based on their specific needs.
Inside the team’s homepage will live important sub-pages, like one for team structure, or a database of all projects.
----
As a manager, this foundation is built to grow with your team. As you build out processes or add new tools, this information can be neatly organized in the team's wiki, neatly blending flexibility with structure.
You can store all kinds of complex, diverse information inside databases. When certain information is accessible by your entire team, work becomes centralized, leading to less confusion.
Create three company-wide databases for your roadmap, documents, and meeting notes.
Your company-wide roadmap should be shared by all teammates, so they can see what's planned (and plan for it). Use a board database here, which is ideal for project management.
----
To categorize the entries in this database, useproperties. These can be customized based on the work at hand.
Here are a few that will be useful:
Deadline— add aDateproperty and rename it "Deadline"to ensure that everyone knows when work must be completed by.
Project owner— aPersonproperty allows you to tag others in the workspace by typing@followed by their name. You can call this "Project owner" to tag the person who is responsible for the project.
Status— you can assign statuses to projects by using aSelectproperty and creating different labels, such as "In progress," "For review," and "Done."
----
Every entry in your roadmap opens up as a page. So all project work is collected in one place, enabling cross-functional teamwork because everyone knows where to get project-specific information.
By organizing work in a board, managers get a high-level glance at all the work their teams are executing.
You can create different views in your database which allows you to see the same information in different ways. To create an alternative database view, go to theViewsdropdown on the left. ClickAdd a view, select the type of database you want, rename it, and clickCreate.
You can customize this further, and here are some views that might be useful for your roadmap:
----
Board by status— a board view allows you to group all entries by status, so you can see project statuses, and easily drag and drop projects across from one stage to the next. To group your board by status, go toGroup byand selectStatus.
Board by person— grouping your projects by the person responsible will allow you to quickly see each team member's workload. In theGroup bydropdown, selectProject owner. Each person will have their own column in the board, and their project cards will appear underneath.
Calendar— a calendar view lets you see all projects by their deadlines, as items will appear on the date they are due.
----
Timeline— a timeline organizes your projects chronologically, letting you view the timespan of every project. For timeline view to work well, you'll need two date properties, for the start and end date of each project.
You’ll also need a place to store documentation.
A documents database gives your team a place to go to find any documents they might need to help them get work done, from updated processes to design specs.
Your docs database could be a table or list database, and the following properties will come in handy:
Last edited time— this lets you see the most recent updates to a document so you can track progress.
----
Type of doc— add aSelectproperty and create tags for different types of documents you create (technical spec, architecture overview, etc.).
Status— to assign status to your documents, use anotherSelectproperty. You can then tag documents asIn progress,For review, etc.
Reviewers— with aPersonproperty, tag anyone who needs to review the document.
Priority— assign a priority level with aSelectproperty. This will come in handy later if you want to arrange your docs in order of priority.
Some different views you could use for your documents database:
What’s current— a filtered view showing documents tagged “In progress” or that relate to an ongoing project.
----
Document type— create views for different types of docs, such as a view for all your project proposals or research documents.
By person— you can have views for each of your team members so that they can see any documents where they are tagged.
With a shared meeting notes databases, even employees in different time zones can provide async updates and review action items — they're part of these meetings, even if they weren't there physically.
Some useful properties for a meeting notes database:
Created time— use theCreated timeproperty so you can see when a meeting took place and organize your list with the most recent at the top.
----
Type of meeting— add aSelectproperty and create tags for different types of meetings, like weekly sync or all-hands.
Meeting participants— aPersonproperty will let you tag all the people who attended the meeting.
Just like with your projects and docs, you can create views based on your database properties. For example, you can create a view of your meetings database that's filtered to show only meetings that took place this week. After you've added a new view, you can click onFilter, and choose whereMeeting date,is within,The past week.
The other aspect of a manager’s job is supervising the people that make up your team. Here are some tools you can use to manage the people on your team.
----
Create a shared page between you and all your direct reports for 1:1 meetings, which will give you both a place to take notes and prepare. This can be a full-page database.
To streamline these meetings, you can create a template that prompts each attendee to provide updates or feedback. That way, you give the meeting some structure. And when you learn a better way to conduct these meetings? Just update the template.
As part of the template, you can even include that teammate's quarterly goals. If you have adatabase with your team's goals, link a view of that database at the top of your meeting notes to have a weekly review of their progress.
----
To create a linked database, use the/command and selectCreate linked database. From the dropdown, choose the database you want to link to. In this case, it'd be a database where you enter all your team's goals. Then, apply a filter so that this database only displays goals assigned to this particular team member.
An upvote database gives team members a chance to voice their opinions and allows you to take your team’s considerations into account.
You can use this database to collect feedback and suggestions before Q&A sessions and all-hands meetings or let team members vote on which product feature should be up next for development.
----
We have a full guide to creating and using anupvote database, which helps managers ensure their team members feel included in company decision-making.
By setting up database templates, you'll make sure that everyone is reading from the same script, and starting every project, meeting, or document with the same criteria. They’re especially helpful for recurring projects or meetings.
To make a database template, click the arrow next toNewon the database, and click+ New template.
----
You can create templates for work that's often repeated. For example, in your projects database, you could have a template for the types of projects your team often works on (like a design spec or a bug report), and in the meetings database, create templates for meetings that happen regularly (like a weekly sync or post-mortem).
In your docs database, you could create a template for RFC.
This stands for "Request for Comment,” and it’s a document that invites teams to join a discussion — a great way for managers to get their team's feedback about a particular idea.
----
You can fill out your templates with information that will help teams get started quickly on the work, including headers and bullet points, questions, and checklists for action items. They'll help your team follow follow processes and reduce repetitive work.
Now that you have systems for managing both work and people, Notion helps managers link this work together, so they have a full line of sight into projects and the people behind them.
Notion gives you the ability to link databases, which can connect big projects with the smaller tasks it takes to complete them.
----
For example, by connecting your projects database with your meeting notes, you’ll be able to link meetings to the projects they relate to. When you open up the project you’ll have access to all the meeting notes that correspond to it.
To find out more about linking databases, have a look at our guide to usingrelation and rollup properties.
It’s easy for team members to get lost in the day-to-day and lose sight of how their work fits into the larger team and company goals.
We’ve devised agoal-setting systemthat keeps goals top of mind, encourages taking action towards them and ensures that everyone can see the context behind the work they’re doing.
----
It's easy for everyone to share information and work together in Notion, both within your team and with other departments across your organization.
Here's how we think about the best ways to work with other teammates:
Use person properties— whether it's the person who's leading the meeting or the one responsible for completing a project, using a person property creates a clear owner of the work at hand. It's also the person anyone with questions about the work should come to.
----
Where to use comments— there's a lot more to say about , but here's how you can use them effectively. For anything in-line and specific, comment and tag teammates in the body of a page. For high-level updates, use page comments (at the top of a page) to communicate that something is ready for review or you've completed feedback.
Set up permission groups— these make sharing work across departments a breeze. You can for each team at your company. Then when work is ready to share with the engineering or marketing team, all you have to do is share with that group, instead of going through and sharing with individual members of those teams.

Mastering the RACI model for effective project management
Notion is a sleek place from which you can confidently run any project, and is ideal for building a RACI matrix.
RACI is a project management method used to assign roles for each task.
R is for Responsible (who does the task), A is for Accountable (who approves the task), C is for Consulted (who needs to give input), and I is for Informed (who needs to know about the task completion).
Add each of these roles as properties in your Notion database.
Include multiple views to your RACI database, such as one that only shows tasks connected toMe.Mewill reflect whoever is signed into Notion at the time.
----
Database entries in Notion are pages themselves, where you can store all the information regarding a task.
For more repetitive tasks, try creating a template button, and configure the content you want to replicate.
You can connect a task page to a Slack channel, so that any updates to the doc will be relayed there.
Keeping work within the task pages of your Notion database is helpful: the more time people spend there, the more familiar they will be with everyone's roles and their own.

Migrate from Confluence to Notion and transform your wiki into a connected workspace
In your existing team wiki, information may be difficult to access, and creating new wiki content is a frustrating process. Maybe your docs are gathering dust, and you have no idea whether team members are using that information in their daily work.
----
What if you could breathe new life into all the information you’ve amassed, and build a library of accurate information where employees can quickly find what they need? In Notion, you can grow your knowledge base and build powerful connections between documentation and daily work, which live side by side. Instead of hopping from tool to tool, you can organize information, manage projects and tasks, take notes, and more, all in one place.
Migrating your Confluence wiki might seem like a daunting task, but it only takes a few steps with our importer. In this guide, you’ll learn how to transform your static docs into a connected workspace, where information helps your teams stay aligned and productive.
----
Your team wiki is home to everything from your company mission statement and goals to standard operating procedures, onboarding documents, training materials, and more.
But it doesn’t have to be just a place of reference. With Notion, you have the flexibility to connect the dots between documentation and daily work, meaning teams always have the necessary context behind what they do.
In your Notion wiki, you can:
Build pages and edit information easily— For non-technical teams, creating pages in Confluence can be intimidating and time-consuming. Notion’s user-friendly interface makes contributing to the wiki more accessible for everyone.
----
Connect all your work seamlessly— Instead of linking out to other tools, Notion puts both documentation and work in the same place. This means wiki documents can live next to project specs, and just a click away from the product roadmap.
Create custom workflows— Software shouldn't dictate the way you work, your team should. Notion is malleable enough to fit any process (even workflows custom to only your team), whether it’s a project-specific Kanban board or customizable templates used for recurring projects.
----
When a wiki functions as both a home to information and a place to get work done every day, it becomes the singular hub for just about anything your employees need. Everyone can go faster, with more information, and more connection to one another.
You can migrate your Confluence wiki to Notion either by using the API importer or importing a zip file.
Use the API importer if:
You’re importing an entire Confluence space over to Notion
You want to migrate users and/or comments
Your Confluence space is less than 15GB in size
Opt for the file importer if:
You only want to import certain pages within your Confluence space
You don’t need to migrate users and/or comments.
Your selected pages to import are less than 5GB
----
Next, we’ll explain both methods.
The API importer is the best way to migrate your entire space into Notion. You’ll keep all your comments, and Confluence users will be mapped to existing Notion users via email or username. If no user exists in Notion, placeholders will be created until the users sign up.
To import your Confluence space via the importer:
Click theImportbutton in your Notion sidebar (on the bottom left) and selectConfluence.
Choose theImport via APIoption.
Select your Confluence instance type — eitherCloudorServer. You can find your instance type by going to theHelpmenu in Confluence.
Go through the authentication process (this will vary according to your instance type).
----
Next, begin the import by clicking on the Confluence menu and select the
Confluence spacethat you want to import.
On the following screen, you can monitor the progress of your import. This may take some time, depending on the size of the space. You’ll receive an email once the import is complete.
If you only want to transfer certain pages and don’t need to map usernames and comments, we recommending importing via a zip file.
Step 1: Export your Confluence wiki
Go toSpace Settingson the sidebar in your Confluence space.
UnderManage Space, clickExport Spaceinside the card view.
ChooseHTMLfrom the format options and clickNext>>
You’ll then be presented with export HTML options. ClickCustom Export.
----
Select which pages you want to export from Confluence and import to Notion and clickExport. Keep in mind that the total number of pages and large attachments can increase export size and complexity!
Allow your export to finish processing. This could take some time. Grab a snack.
After the export is complete, clickDownload hereto save the export to your computer. You’ll get a zip file that contains the HTML version of the pages you selected.
If you don’t see these options, you might need to request permission to export from your workspace admin.
Be sure to export your Confluence pages as HTML.
Step 2: Import your Confluence pages into Notion
Click theImportbutton in your sidebar (on the bottom left).
----
ClickConfluencefrom the button menu and selectImport via file
Find the zip file containing your exported Confluence pages and select it to be uploaded. Don’t worry about unzipping the file! Just upload the entire archive.
Give it a few minutes for the upload to complete. Ensure that you don’t close your browser window until uploading is complete.
After the upload is complete, you can see your import progressing on the screen. This step may take several hours depending on the size of the exported zip file. You can safely close your browser window once you see the importing page… message on the screen. We will send you an email once the import is completed.
Importing your Confluence workspace
----
For step-by-step instructions on importing from Confluence with either method, view ourHelp Center article.
In Notion you can create documents, databases and bring content from external tools so all your company’s information lives in a single place.
Here are some examples of how to customize your wiki in Notion:
Turn your knowledge into a wiki— Add powerful features to your knowledge base byturning it into a wiki, where you can tag pages with properties, verify documents and view your content in versatile database layouts. Go to the options menu…and selectTurn to Wiki.
----
Verify pages to signal that content is up to date— Withpage verification, you can verify content until a certain date (or indefinitely). Team members will trust the information in wiki pages, and you can ensure everything stays up to date and accurate.
Keep your projects and docs polished with templates— You can endlessly customize your team’s workspace in Notion, but there’s no need to start from scratch. Use
database  templatesto kickoff projects and create documents, and customize them as you go.
----
Create top-level pages and nestle sub-pages within— In your wiki homepage, create pages for all the topics and sub-pages inside them. After you’ve usedTurn to Wiki,  your wiki will have database features, meaning you can search for information and useviews, filters and sortsto find what you need, fast.
Structure your wiki in an easy-to-navigate layout— You can drag and drop pages into columns, create headers and dividers to lay all your information out clearly. Add flair to your wiki page with emojis, icons, images and page covers - this also makes it clearer to navigate
----
Ask Notion AI to help you create wiki content— Hit the spacebar to call upNotion AI— this built-in AI assistant will help you quickly draft any kind of wiki content, or edit and improve what you’ve written.
Collaborate seamlessly with commenting and tags— You can comment on any wiki page, either in the comment section at the top or on specific content throughout the page. Tag people using the @ key so you know they will see it. You can also mention and link to any workspace page. Learn more about
collaborating in Notion.
----
Give everyone the right access to wiki content— Usesharing and permissionsettings to make sure everyone has the right level of access to content. You can grant full access to some team members, while others will only be able to view or comment on certain pages.
Sync content from other parts of the workspace— Copy and paste content from anywhere in the workspace and then turn this into asynced block, so it will update everywhere anytime changes are made.
Use connecting databases to manage projects, tasks, notes and docs— You can create databases forprojects, tasks,notes, and docs. Then connect all these with a relation property to build links between all aspects of your work.
----
You’ll be able to recreate most of the Confluence features in Notion with different block types.
For example:
List action items in a to-do list— If you need to tick off action items, create aTo-do listblock.
Expand and collapse content inside toggle headings— In place of Confluence’s Expand feature, you can useToggleandToggle headingsin Notion.
Use callouts instead of panels— Confluence has Panels for different types of content, like Info, Decision, Note, Success, Error, and Warning. In Notion, create aCalloutand customize it however you want.
----
Organize information in tables or databases— You can create Tables and Tables with Images in Confluence. In Notion, you can insert aSimple tableinto a page or organize information in more advanced databases.
Add bullets and checklists to simple tables— To replace bullets and checklists in tables, you can use emojis, hyphens or brackets.
Embed images into pages— While Notion doesn’t yet have integrations with Gliffy and
Draw.io, you can embed content from those apps inImageformat.

Migrating to Notion for Project Management
Project managementin Notion is a powerful solution that easily connects projects to documents, notes, and wikis to keep everything in one place. While many tools are standalone and require specific workflows, Notion gives you the flexibility to customize projects to your exact needs.
In this guide, we’ll discuss how project management in Notion works, some of its key features, and best practices for keeping the most productive and connected workspace possible.
----
Out of the box, project management in Notion comes with two primary areas that are connected to one another:ProjectsandTasks. Both of these are pre-configured, specialized databases, giving you the powerful ability to link your projects and tasks to pages in Notion.
This system, like everything else you do in Notion, can also be customized to fit the needs of your team. Whether that’s creating a filtered view based on a specific property or adding in tags to help your team stay organized, Notion Projects gives you the flexibility to work with more speed and clarity.
Before you get started managing your projects in Notion, let’s go through a few of the fundamental features that project management is built on.

No-code building blocks —Notion gives users more control over their workspace with lots of customization. Each page in Notion can be built using a variety of blocks (like text, to-do lists, images, code snippets, embeds, and more) to create a workspace that truly reflects your team's workflow.
Databases —Databases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Databases can be used for anything — a collection of meeting notes, your core database of projects and tasks, a document storage system, and so much more. Information in your databases can be viewed in multiple ways, from a list to a calendar to kanban board.
----
Document collaboration —Not only can you collaborate on tasks, but you can also work together on documents and notes. It’s great for brainstorming, meeting minutes, proposals and briefs, and collaborative writing.
Nested pages —Notion allows you to create a page within a page (called a sub-page), which can help organize complex projects and keep related content together.
Templates —Notion has a variety of templatesfor different uses – from project management to meeting agendas, team wikis, and CRMs. Using these templates makes getting setup and up-to-speed easier than ever.
----
We recommend identifying a few representatives from your team to manage the setup and migration process before inviting the rest of your organization into your Notion workspace.
If you need help troubleshooting any issues, please contact Notion support. Need additional support throughout the migration process? You can work with a Notion Certified Consultant by visitingnotion.so/consultants.
Migrating from one tool to another can be a big initiative. To ease the change management process, prepare some internal communication, resources, and escalation paths within your organization to make the transition as easy as possible.
Email templates
----
Communicating this change within your organization can be a challenge. To help communicate the transition from your previous tool into Notion, we created a few email templates to use.

Monday
Moving terms into Notion
You can rename any field in a Notion database. Prefer the term “epic”? You can rename projects to “epics” to minimize confusion.
----
Your Notion workspace has plenty of flexibility when it comes to admin, security, provisioning, and more. As a workspace owner or admin, it’s important to keep Notion clean, productive, and secure by turning on and off specific settings to fit your needs.
A few general best practices include:
Check your admin settings to ensure the right people are able to change settings and add users
Updating permissions for teamspaces so everyone in your workspace can edit as needed
Verify your workspace security settings to make sure your guest and sharing restrictions are set
Check your connections to make sure all integrations are properly configured
To learn how you can get set up in Notion,read our guide here.
----
To fully setup your Notion workspace in a way that works best for your organization, we recommend having a strategy in place to manage all your information through the migration. Below, we cover how you can decide what migration strategy fits your needs, and how you can optimally organize your workspace.
What to migrate to Notion
As with any migration, there are pros and cons to each approach. It’s important to understand exactly how your team or company plan on working and what makes the most sense for your workflows.
----
Start fresh —Starting with a clean slate means that you and your team can fully customize your Notion experience to your needs, and take advantage of Notion’s flexibility and connectivity. However, it may require you archive your old tool to retain data for audit and regulatory purposes, or create a custom import if users need access.
Migrate all data —This option maintains a record of your past information all in Notion without the need to keep your previous tool. Depending on the amount of data you’re moving over, however, it may clutter your workspace and overwhelm your processes. This option will likely require additional help from an internal or external IT team to ease the process.
----
Cut-off date —Only migrating data after a specific date reduces the amount of information migrated and makes it easy to know exactly what will be pulled into Notion. Like the previous strategies, this will likely require you archive your old tool for audit and regulatory purposes.
Migrate active projects only —Moving projects that are actively in flight is a good way to reduce clutter and technical debt without overwhelming amounts of data. This option still allows you to customize your new workflows in Notion while maintaining current information. However, it may require you archive your old tool to retain data for audit and regulatory purposes, or create a custom import if users need access.
----
There’s no single strategy that fits every company, so it’s important to work with your team and cross-functional partners to figure out which will best suit your needs.For most teams, we suggest either migrating projects after a certain date or moving active projects only to minimize clutter in your workspace.
Creating new workflows
Many customers use this as a chance to redefine workflows and build more streamlined project management processes.
How to organize your workspace
It’s important to decide how you want to organize information within your workspace. Within your company workspace, you can create dedicatedteamspacesfor every team that can be customized to fit their needs.
----
For smaller teams, we recommend using one general teamspace with databases for tasks, projects, docs, and meetings. Since information within a teamspace is accessible and connected by default, it’s easy to set up and work in one place.
For larger teams, we recommend creating individual teamspaces for every team (e.g., Marketing, Product & Engineering, Finance, etc.), each with its own wiki, tasks, and projects. This allows teams to work how they need, but they can still connect with others between teamspaces.
There are two ways to migrate your project management information into Notion.
If you’re migrating from Asana, please use our importer tool.Refer to our Asana migration guide for more information on how to get started.
----
If you’re migrating from any other project management tool, you will need to move your information manually.
To start migrating projects into Notion, simply add theProjects& taskstemplate. Selecting this will add both a Projects database and a Tasks database to your teamspace. If you manage projects through sprints or require issue tracking, you can use theProjects, Tasks, & Sprintstemplate to get additional functionality.
Using projects and teamspaces
We recommend you have one projects database per teamspace so teams can each have their own sources of truth but quickly connect to the rest of the workspace.
----
For each of your teamspaces, create projects and tasks that correspond with their counterparts in your legacy tool in these project and task databases. The two databases will already be connected because they arerelated databases.
Once you have your projects and tasks added, you can add information associated with each project or task (such as status, assignee, or comments) as properties in the database and customize your project setup. Here are some key features and configurations to consider:
----
Add projects & tasks details —In addition to the preset properties and views that come with these templates, you canadd custom fieldsandrelated databasesto fit Notion into your existing workflows. To add new property fields, go to your menu in your database, click onProperties, and then click on+ New Property. At the top, you’ll see suggested properties that may be helpful to your team, such as estimates or a unique ID.
Views —Each database can be displayed in many different visualizations, or what we call views. In addition to table view, the contents of a database can be visualized as a list, board, calendar, gallery, or timeline - whatever makes the information the most useful. To learn more about database views,see the.
----
Issue tracking —TheProjects, Tasks, & Sprintstemplate features a unique ID for each task, an integration with GitHub so you can link the relevant PRs to your task, an easy way to view your backlog.
Sprints —TheProjects, Tasks, & Sprintstemplate comes with a set-up that allows you to do task management in time-boxed sprints. It features a “Complete sprint” button that helps you move tasks between sprints and close out work that’s already been completed.
Automating workflows —Create customButtonsto complete multiple steps in one click, like adding a new task, assigning it to a team member and giving it a status. If your team works in sprints, learn about sprint automations here.
----
Portfolios, goal-setting and OKRs —If you have projects that are bucketed into larger themes (such as portfolios or objectives), you can link them to your projects by creating an additional database to your teamspace that you can use to pull in projects. An easy way to get started is to open the Templates gallery and duplicate the OKR and goal setting templates into your workspace. Create a relation property to the database that’s tracking those goals or objectives.Learn more about creating Relations here.
Project management is just one piece of your Notion workspace. Build anything with code-free blocks, consolidate your work and get more done with Notion AI.
----
Notion’sStatusproperty is split into three status categories:To do,In progress, andDone. Since every team operates differently and requires different statuses to work effectively (likeTo be reviewedorEditing), you can create custom statuses to cover every step in your task or project management process.
Using and customizing the Status property can add a lot of flexibility to your work. You can do things like:
Filter your database to only show project that are in progress
Use the calendar view to show a view of published projects
Build custom workflows for each team creating specific statuses for marketing, product, design, and more
----
Notion pages can be built using all kinds of blocks — text, images, bullet points, checklists, and more. You can even embed content from other tools, create tables, and create a link between content from page to page so things update automatically. This means project pages no longer just link out to your work — they are your work.
With all of these features (and more), you can build a workspace that fits your needs now, and update it if and when those needs change. Do things like:
Standardize your processes using templates to keep your projects consistent and on track
Use Notion AI to help you draft project outlines and briefs and give your team back valuable time
----
Give your team and your partners the updates they need by embedding content from specialized tools like Figma, Miro, Github, Jira, and more.
Notion AI can help you write, edit, and create new ideas all without leaving your workspace.
With this powerful, built-in AI tool, you can get more quality work done in a fraction of the time it used to take. Notion AI can:
Turn a few bulleted ideas into a fully-written doc in minutes, then extract action items and build a to-do list.
Create a summary of every project and task using AI autofill, giving you a high level digest of all your work
Brainstorm new feature ideas and inspire new ways of thinking for the future

Formulas 2.0: How to use Notion’s new and improved formulas with your existing setups
We improved the formulas experience so that: (1) it’s easier to write formulas, (2) formula outputs include more property types, and (3) the formula language can fulfill more specific needs.
What about my existing formulas?
Click to expand
In this guide, we’ll look at what’s new with formulas, and talk about what that means for current formula users. If you’re new to formulas entirely, consider checking out our beginner guide onhow to write Notion formulas that extend the capabilities of your databases.
Here’s what’s new with formulas 2.0:
----
Writing and editing formulas is easier— Formulas can be written multi-line in the editor (with tabs and comments too!), and errors are more actionable. When you write formulas, you’ll see an expanded editor box that supports multi-line editing – making it easier to view and edit long formulas. Plus, we now type-check and highlight errors directly in the editor box, so you can easily fix your syntax and ensure your formulas work.
Formulas now support rich data outputs— previously, formulas only supported text, numeric, and checkbox (boolean) outputs. Now, they also support displaying pages, dates, people, and lists.
----
You can access more information directly —formulas are now smarter, so they can reach into properties of related databases, as well as access information like member’s emails and names.
New formula language
Click to expand
Previously, formulas flattened a bunch of different data types into text. With new formulas, you can now get richer data type outputs.
Since we know that people rely on formula outputs looking and behaving a certain way, to preserve output compatibility, all existing formulas that reference rollup, person, file, and multi-select properties were converted to text.
----
For example, where you previously hadprop("Person")returning people’s names as text, you’ll now seeprop("Person").map(current.format()).join(", "). This is because with formulas 2.0,prop("Person")will now return a list of people instead of just a comma-separated text-value. With the migration, we preserve your original output by converting each item each item in the “person” list to text values, separated by commas.
If you want to use the rich data type improvements, you’ll need to remove the conversion language. In the example above, that means just usingprop("Person")directly. In this case, your output will now return a list of people type objects instead of plain text.
Dynamic property mentions
Click to expand
----
You can now access workspace-level information like the names and emails of people tagged in your database, or a related database, without having to create these as their own property.
For example, you can retrieve data such as the user's full name and email using the "Created By" property and then referencing “name” asprop("Created By").name()or "email" asprop("Created By").email().
This lets you streamline properties on your larger databases, and still retrieve the necessary information without having to go through multiple steps.
Dot notation now supported
Click to expand
----
Formulas now support local variable creation. Just like with traditional Javascript,letcreates a variable using the name of the first argument and the value of the second argument. The third argument is where you write the rest of your formula, using your newly created variable.
For example, if you’re writing a formula that references total cost, where cost is the sum of a few properties, you may not want to sum together those properties multiple times while writing your formula.
Instead, consider creating a variable withlet(SalesTax, (prop("Subtotal")*0.099), prop("Subtotal") + SalesTax). Then, every time you typeSalesTaxyou’ll be able to use the predefined value of subtotal times the tax rate.
When should I use a variable?
Click to expand
----
Once you’ve gotten the hang of working withlet, you can also useletsfor many variable assignments at once!
For example, you could combine two variables withlets(a, "Hello", b, "world", a + " " + b).
You can now pinpoint the exact information you need in a related database, without having to first create a rollup to reference that property. Combined with formula’s ability to edit and change the way that information is displayed — this becomes far more powerful than a regular rollup.
For example, if you have a database of Projects related to a database of Tasks, you may be interested in showing whether the tasks are"✅ Complete","⚠️ In progress", or"❌ Not started"based on the % of completed tasks.
----
Previously, you would’ve had to create a rollup to show task completion,and thencreate a formula that acts on that information to return"✅ Complete","⚠️ In progress", or"❌ Not started".
With new formulas, you can combine these actions and define your “rollup value” as a variable.
First, get the number of completed tasks using themap(),filter(), andlength()functions.
prop("Tasks").map(current.prop("Status")).filter(current == "Done").length()
2. Then, define the rollup value in a variable calledpercentComplete— to do this divide the number of completed tasks, total task, then multiplying by 100  — and voila! You can now apply functions to your new value.
----
let(percentComplete,prop("Tasks").map(current.prop("Status")).filter(current == "Done").length()/ prop("Tasks").map(current.prop("Status")).length() * 100),/* write the rest of your formula here */)
In this specific example, your final formula could look something like this.
let(percentComplete, round(prop("Tasks").map(current.prop("Status")).filter(current =="Done").length()/ prop("Tasks").map(current.prop("Status")).length() * 100),ifs(percentComplete == 100, "✅ All tasks complete", percentComplete > 0, "⚠️ In progress (" + percentComplete + ")%","❌ Not started"))

Use Notion AI to write better, more efficient notes and docs
Notion AI is a connected assistant that helps you think bigger, work faster, and augments your creativity, right inside the functional workspace you’re already familiar with.
If your day to day involves reading docs, writing content, or taking notes, Notion AI can make you more efficient. There’s no need to bounce between tools to improve writing or extract insights. Plus, you don’t need to waste time on formatting, formalities, or straightforward text generation, helping you lean into the highest priority tasks in your day.
Learn more about Notion AI pricing, privacy, and more
----
For a limited time, Notion AI is free to try. Check out the reference docs on Notion AI for more details on theNotion AI Supplementary Terms,pricing information, andFAQs.
Notion AI produces text responses based on user's questions and the current page context.
Pull up Notion AI in one of three ways, depending on your needs in that moment.
To improve existing content,highlight text and select Ask AI. Then, pick an option from the dropdown or write a custom prompt.
To generate a summary or extract insights from a page,type/AIto view AI blocks, or ask Notion AI to write anything for you.
To draft new text,use thespacekey on a new page or line and enter any prompt.
----
In this guide we’ll explore some of the many practical ways these three actions can improve your document writing, reading, and editing experience.
How does artificial intelligence produce text?
Learn about what artificial intelligence is, as well as the current functions and limitations of this technology within Notion and beyond inthis guide →
AI is often thought of as a tool to author information based on a prompt. Notion AI can certainly do that, but it really shines as a follow-up to make sense of your mostly completed thoughts.
----
Highlight text andAsk AIto do anything to offload time-consuming tasks that Notion AI can do in seconds: extract action items from meeting notes, distill insights from customer research notes, even generate high-quality translations.
Summarizing messy notes for stakeholders (and your future self) can be a lengthy and tedious process. You know what you talked about, they know what you talked about, but someone still needs to write it down. Or at least they did. Now Notion AI can do it for you.
----
Special AI blocks — summarize, action items, and custom content — use the power of Notion AIplusthe context from the page on which they’re deployed to create perfectly-custom content that you can’t generate anywhere else. What's more, they can be baked intodatabase templatesas a regular part of your meeting process.
Three “advanced blocks” make use of AI features.
Recap with/summarize—create an executive overview in seconds. Notion AI will use context from your document to generate a few sentences that summarizes the entire document.
Pull out action items with/action items—whether you’re analyzing an entire call transcript or hastily taken notes, Notion AI can help you remember what you committed to doing next.
----
Write anything with/custom AI block—ask Notion AI to expand on a thought outlined on the page, or write a counter-argument to your main point. Unlike starting from scratch, this block makes use of what’s on the page to inform its output, leading to a more helpful result.
Use AI blocks in database templates
If your meeting routine includes usingdatabase templatesto structure agendas or prompt discussion, consider adding AI blocks to the templates directly to encourage automating follow up tasks as a team.
----
Sometimes, its easy to get ideas on a page, but can take hours to format those same thoughts into a presentable document to share with your team or the world. With Notion AI, you can quickly move from scrappy notes to polished docs. Here’s just a few ways you might try this in your workspace:
Write bullet points, have AI do the rest —job descriptions, performance reviews, and so much more. Write a list of requirements or accomplishments, then ask AI to “create a paragraph covering this content” or “make this sound more professional.”
----
Identify key insights quickly— use AI to pinpoint the most important parts of a document and quickly gain insight without extensive reading. Try asking AI to “create a list of bullet points with important items” or even “summarize this information in a table.”
Analyze large text-based data sets —no need to sort through hundreds of open-ended survey results to understand group sentiment. With Notion AI you can highlight a large body of text and ask for a bullet point summary of any length. Try asking AI to “pull out the most five common themes from this data” or to count how many times a specific request was mentioned.
Custom prompts to get you started
Not sure what to ask AI? Here's a few things to try:
----
Create a list of bullet points with important items
Summarize this information in a table
Pull out common themes from this data
Stop bouncing between tools and waiting for copy review to move into the next phase of editing when writing a lengthy doc. Notion AI can help you quickly transform existing content into something more suited to the task at hand, without the need for manual reconfiguring. Whether you need to adapt the tone of a document, fix spelling and grammar, find synonyms, or translate content into another language, Notion AI can help.
With Notion AI, you can easily move between tasks and produce the right output for any situation. Here’s just some of the things you can ask AI to do for you:
----
Adapt tone of writing —the way you explain a project to peers might not be the right way to phrase something to an executive, even if the content is more or less the same. Take an existing draft or stream of consciousness paragraph, and ask Notion AI to “make this more professional,” or “summarize key points as an overview.”
Translate content into another language —if you’re working with a global team or global clients, you understand how time-consuming translation can be. Start with some text, submit a request in another app, wait a few days, then paste translated content back where you started. With Notion AI you can generate quick, accurate translations between many languages, right where you’re doing the rest of your work.
----
Get synonyms and define words— whether you’re reading a complex doc and need to quickly define words, or writing one and trying to find the right phrase to capture your thoughts, Notion AI can help. Get your thoughts on the page in whatever form they come to you, then simply highlight a selection of text and select an option from the dropdown.
When you’re stuck staring at a blank page, ask Notion AI for ideas — or an entire draft — to get started. Provide a prompt or some initial ideas, and AI can help generate content for you in whatever format you request. Once an output is generated, continue asking Notion AI for revisions until you’re happy with the result. Then you can just fine-tune the result.
----
No matter how or why you are using Notion AI, the best way to get the output you want is to focus on specificity of the prompt. To that end, we asked Notion AI how to write a good prompt (couldn’t have said it much better ourselves). Follow these tips when writing your own custom prompts, and keep in mind that you can always respond to Notion AI to refine the output into something you like.
Start with a clear goal in mind. What do you want AI to generate for you?
Make sure your prompt is specific and focused. This will help AI understand what you're asking for and produce a more accurate output.
Provide as much context as possible. Include any relevant background information, keywords, or requirements like desired output length or tone.
----
Keep it simple. Avoid overly complicated language or jargon.
So, what does that look like in practice? Consider the following prompts, and how they might be improved according to the guidance above.
Instead of “write an instagram caption about interior design,” ask it to “write an instagram caption about modern light fixtures. Keep the tone friendly, and the overall length under 300 characters. Include 3-5 relevant hashtags”
Instead of “brainstorm product features for a software app,” try including specific goals your team is trying to accomplish, and a description of what your software app does.
----
While we can talk about the value of Notion AI all day long, the best proof is seeing it in action. So, we asked it to summarize this guide. Pretty neat, right?
The article describes how to use an AI assistant in Notion to help summarize and edit documents. The assistant can generate summaries, extract key points or action items, translate between languages, rewrite sections to change tone, suggest synonyms, and more. Users can highlight text and select "Ask AI" or type "/AI" to get AI suggestions. The assistant uses context from the page and custom user prompts to produce outputs. Examples show how to use the assistant to summarize meetings, polish bullet point lists into paragraphs, and analyze survey data.

Bring live links into your Notion workspace with link previews
Link previews is a feature built using Notion’s API that allows your external tools to live and breathe in your Notion workspace. You can see live, synced visualizations of tools like Jira, GitHub, Slack, Trello and Asana in Notion pages, bringing information from different tools in one place to streamline your workflows. That can help your team stay aligned — which is especially important when the average company uses88 different toolsto get work done.
But you don’t need to be a developer to start using link previews. In fact, you don’t need to write a single line of code to connect multiple apps to Notion. Here’s how to do it, and what it can enable for your team.
----
It's easy to lose focus when you spend so much time juggling software. But with link previews, you can see updates from those external tools in once place to better concentrate on the task at hand — instead of getting an update from this tool or needing to get information from that tool.
Here's what it means for you:
Engineering teams move faster— when you can access information from Jira, GitHub, and Slack in one Notion page, you spend less time switching between each app and invest the saved time in rolling out faster updates and bug fixes.
----
Write rich wikis and documents— bring information from external tools into yourteam wikisand documents, adding more value to your knowledge bases. Introduce your external tools in your onboarding docs to allow new hires to get familiar with your team's workflow.
Everything happens in one workspace— collaborate with your team to discuss, plan and execute workflows cohesively with information from external tools in one Notion workspace, bringing transparency and clarity to your team’s workflow.
Make better decisions— make it easy for managers and decision-makers to view all information in one place. This gives them the ability to make quick decisions on ongoing projects using up-to-date information.
----
When you paste a link in your Notion page — such as a link to a Jira ticket, GitHub PR, Slack message, or any other supported platform — you'll see the options to paste the link in one of the three ways:
Paste as preview
Paste as mention
Paste as link
What about unsupported links?
Click to expand
After you choose toPaste as previeworPaste as mention, this will show live, up-to-date content fetched from the source of the URL in the preview block, like a Slack message URL showing a Slack message preview, or a Jira issue link showing a Jira issue preview. It's similar to creating a link embed or any bookmark.
Here's how you can generate a link preview:
----
When youPaste as preview, your link gets inserted as a separate block within the flow of the page with clean visualization of the content fetched from the source URL.
When youPaste as mention, it generates a condensed view of the link preview. You canPaste as mentiondirectly inline, next to other text.
To show content from external tools in Notion, you’ll need to connect your app and authenticate your account, which is easy, secure, and quick.
When you paste the external link in a doc for the first time, you'll see a button that says
Connect to [App] to updateon the empty preview block to connect to the app and allow access to your account.
----
Once you click on the button, you'll be redirected to another browser window that'll guide you to connect your app via authenticating your account.
Once you complete the authentication process, you'll see a detailed preview of the link content, which is set to update automatically when you or someone with access edits the relevant fields from the source app.
After you authenticate an app for link previews, anyone with access to the respective Notion page can view the link preview content shown on the page. Link previews respect the overall Notion page permissions.
You can easily manage your connections to apps within Notion. Here's how:
----
First, navigate toSettings & Membersmenu in the sidebar. Then, click onMy connected appsto see the apps you've connected that allow you to bring information into Notion. You can also view other apps available for you to connect.
UnderDiscover new apps, clickShow allto see additional apps available to connect.
You canConnectan app for the first time. This redirects you to another window where you can authenticate your account with Notion.
Once you've connected your app, it'll show up underConnected apps, where you can choose to connect a different account or manage multiple accounts for the same app — yes, you can connect multiple accounts for the same integrated app! Here's how:
----
Say you start using link previews with one of your Slack accounts for a specific workspace but you want to unfurl a message from another workspace. There are two ways to go about this:
Paste the link right into Notion where we'll first try to unfurl your link using the first account we already have authenticated with you, but if that fails, you'll see a prompt to authenticate with an appropriate account in Slack.
Or, you can go intoMy connected appsand connect as many accounts as you'd like.
Can I paste a link preview in a comment, page title, or text field in a database?At present, no. Just page content, for now.
----
Can multiple users in a workspace authenticate with an integration?Yes. You don't have to be a workspace admin to use link previews. Everyone will need to authenticate themselves to be able to create a preview.
How often does the data refresh within a link preview?We update link previews automatically on a continuous basis. The actual frequency may vary, depending on the source app and other factors.

Notion Enterprise security provisions
Your wikis, docs, and projects live side by side in Notion, a connected workspace where all teams can collaborate and track work.
Since Notion is the hub for your most valuable intellectual property, you need to know that your data is secure and all the necessary protections are in place to make sure you operate in compliance.
In this guide, you’ll learn how Notion’s security and compliance features for Enterprise plans allow you to have complete enterprise-grade experience and keep your company data safe.
Workspace owners have full control over the Notionworkspace security settings, which you can find in theSecuritytab in your workspace settings.
----
To secure your workspace, you can make use of the following settings:
Disable public page sharing— this will disable the Share to web option in the Share menu on every page in this workspace.
Disable guests— this prevents anyone from inviting people outside the workspace to any page. However, even with “Disable guests” turned on for the workspace, workspace owners can enable members to send guest invite requests to provide more granular access for external collaborators or guests.
Disable moving or duplicating pages to other workspaces— this prevents data from leaving the workspace via the Move to or Duplicate actions.
Disable export— this prevents anyone from exporting page and database content as PDF, HTML, Markdown & CSV.
----
Disabling all these options will put the tightest lockdown on your content and prevent your content from being shared, downloaded or moved out of the workspace.
Teamspace vs. Workspace security

For more information on admin controls and user management, check out ourEnterprise Guide.
You can build wikis, organize documentation, take meeting notes, manage tasks and projects, and more in Notion.
This means your workspace likely contains sensitive information, like company and employee info in your wikis, client information in docs and meeting notes, and intellectual property in your project management.
----
You’ll need to protect that information regardless of what industry you’re in, but it’s even more vital if your company is in a regulated industry such as healthcare or e-commerce.
That’s why we have pre-built integrations with selected SIEM and DLP security and compliance partners so you can confidently store your data in Notion.
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) combines SIM (security information management) + SEM (security event management) into one system that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats.
----
SIEM integrations collect event log data from various sources, identify unusual activity in real time, and allow configurable, off-the-shelf alerts, reports, and dashboards. By integrating a SIEM solution with Notion, you can bring Notion audit log information into a shared platform where you monitor the rest of your SaaS apps for better analysis, searches, and correlations.
Without a SIEM solution, workspace owners are limited to manually auditing activity for suspicious behavior in the workspace and risk that this activity goes unnoticed.
----
Integrating with a SIEM solution allows you to configure alerts on unusual activity, provide reports, and build dashboards to support incident investigation. These tools enable automated alerts, but do not trigger automated actions in Notion.
Notion integrates withSplunk,SumoLogic,Panther, andDatadog.
Data Loss Protection (DLP) tools prevent users from storing sensitive data in unauthorized platforms or with unauthorized external or internal audiences. These tools use libraries of patterns to identify different types of sensitive data and personally identifiable information (PII).
----
DLP integrations detect the use of sensitive data and take automated action to remediate data breaches quickly — this could be by alerting workspace owners, redacting content, or restricting page access.
Without a DLP integration, Workspace owners don’t have a way to quickly detect the creation or overexposure of sensitive content in their Notion workspace and take action to resolve it. The result is that sensitive content can be created and goes unnoticed. Or, sensitive content can be overexposed if an employee shares it with guests or publishes it to the web.
When you integrate a DLP solution in Notion, you can identify different types of sensitive information stored in Notion and take action to remove them.
----
Notion will be classified and tagged by DLP tools using natural language processing. So, for example, it can recognize sensitive customer information like credit card numbers, Personal Health Information (PHI), secret codes such as passwords and API keys.
You can create alerts to notify workspace owners about sensitive content and trigger automated actions to redact sensitive content from the workspace immediately to help reduce the time of overexposure with manual intervention.
You can also alert workspace owners if content is published to the web or shared externally with guests, and set up automated actions that restrict page permissions to prevent data leaks with unauthorized audiences.
----
Notion integrates with DLP toolsNightfall AIandPolymer(coming soon).
Using these integrations, Workspace owners can manage and monitor Notion in their centralized DLP/SIEM platforms along with all the other tools your company uses.
On Notion’s Enterprise plan, Workspace owners can access additional data and reporting to get deeper insights into how team members interact with content and use the workspace overall.
Here are some of the most impactful data and reporting features currently in Notion Enterprise:
----
Enterprise Workspace owners can export a list of all members under Settings & members > Settings > Export Members as CSV. This CSV export will contain a list of all members in the workspace, including their name, email address, role, what groups they belong to, and their unique Notion user ID.
To help with legal and compliance backups, Enterprise workspace owners can export the workspace in multiple file formats, including CSV, Markdown & PDF. Go to Setting & members > Settings > Export all workspace content. An email from Notion will be sent with a link to download the file(s). The link will expire after 7 days.
----
Enterprise workspace owners have access to an Audit Log (underSettings & members) which gives an overview of a large range of events that have occurred in the workspace. This can be especially helpful for identifying potential security issues, investigating suspicious behavior, and troubleshooting access.
You can drill down using the filter options and export all Audit Log events as a CSV file for a given date range for additional analyses.
Content search provides Enterprise workspace owners with visibility into workspace content to improve governance of the workspace and resolve page access issues:
View who has access to a page
Modify the permissions of a page
----
Discover and re-assign abandoned pages from former employees (including private pages)
WithinContent Search,you can search for a page by itstitleorID. Alternatively, if you don’t know a page’s title or ID, you can use the built-in filters to narrow your results. In addition to the sharing settings (Private, Shared Internally, Shared Externally, Shared to the Web), you can also see:
Page creator and creation date
Last edited by and edited date
With whom the page was shared
Page location (i.e., teamspace)
----
For our customers with stricter regulations around content shared externally, you can filter to see all pages shared externally (with guest access) and pages shared to the web. This provides a comprehensive birds-eye-view of all pages so workspace owners can govern their workspaces more effectively.
As a workspace owner, there may be some cases where help is needed with page permissions on a restricted page or a page that’s been shared inappropriately. For these cases, in the page view underContent Search, you will see the option to Change permissions in the ... menu to the right of each page.
----
All content on a Notion Enterprise workspace is owned by your company. You can sharethis articlewith your employees if they have questions about what data is accessible to Enterprise workspace owners when using a verified domain on Notion.
Notion maintains a comprehensive security and privacy program designed to protect your data in accordance with various regulatory and industry standards.
Notion’s certifications include:
SOC2
SOC3
ISO27001
To support our customers that are subject to HIPAA, Notion has also completed the HIPAA compliance audit so that you may process PHI within your Enterprise workspace, provided that you enable the security features described in ourHelp Center articleand sign Notion’s Business Associate Agreement (BAA).
----
As Notion continues to build an AI-connected workspace, our customer’s security and compliance needs are an integral part of our product strategy. Notion does not use your Customer Data or permit others to use your Customer Data to train the machine learning models used to provide the Notion AI Writing Suite. Your use of the Notion AI Writing Suite does not grant Notion any right or license to your Customer Data to train our machine learning models.

Where does Notion fit into your company’s tool ecosystem?
Notion serves as the connective tissue between people and projects — synthesizing all content and context into a single, reliable source of truth.
But what happens when you need a different tool for the job? Notion complements and enhances it.
We recognize that modern organizations rely on a complex ecosystem of tools (88 different tools on average!) that overlap in some way, shape, or form with Notion. These tools help teams communicate, document, and track work. Ultimately, these tools help us all work better together — one of Notion’s strengths.
----
Notion enhances, rather than replaces, your tool ecosystem. As long as you set clear internal guidelines for where work should happen and leave room for overlap, Notion can help you:
Stay focused when toggling between many different tools.
Reduce context switching by integrating everything you need in one place.
“Keeping everything in Notion means the team only has to learn one tool, instead of bouncing between different tools with different interfaces.” —Dmitri Gaskin, Co-Founder, Branch.
Learn aboutBranch’s documentation system built in Notion, and use itsengineering roadmap template.
----
Since Slack and Notion serve two different channels of communication — Notion for asynchronous collaboration and Slack for real-time discussions — both tools augment one other.
Notion — async collaboration
Single source of truth that is easy to reference and revisit.
Document ideas, action items, and plans.
Long-form writing that cultivates clear thinking and well thought-out ideas.
Slack — real-time discussion
Instant accessibility to the broader team.
Ask questions, discuss, and make decisions in real-time.
Quicker, stream-of-consciousness writing for spontaneous ideation.
These different communication channels complement each other and build synergy
Click to expand
----
Swirling conversations about work can be difficult to keep track of, especially when that information lives in different tools.
Using link previews, you can paste a Slack message right into a Notion page — so you have direct access to information (minus the noise) while still in focus mode. For example, when your content team is writing a new blog post, they can gain access to relevant Slack messages about that post without being distracted by the other messages flying around your channels.
----
While Notion and Slack are two different tools that complement each other, you can also bring those tools inside Notion for better collaboration. Instead of needing to jump between tools and waste time context-switching, here’s how you can bring information into Notion.
Easily embed tools that help enrich Notion pages, so you can tell a complete story. You can embed virtually any online content within Notion pages — from video and audio players to Figma and Invision mockups, to entire Google documents and spreadsheets. This includes streaming multimedia, PDFs, forms, and interactive maps.
----
Designers can embed Figma files into Notion for the marketing team’s feedback. HR can embed Google Maps into a new hire’s welcome page in Notion. Product teams can even embed Typeforms to survey users in Notion. This centralizes information and reduces the need to constantly switch tools and tabs when collaborating cross-functionally.
Using our API,link previewshelp turn Notion into the central organizing hub of your tool ecosystem. They embed real-time, synced visualizations of external tools — without having to leave Notion.
----
All you have to do is paste a link from Jira, Slack, Asana, Trello, or GitHub, and a preview is generated with real-time information fetched directly from the link. Link previews gather information from other tools so you can collaborate with cross-functional teams and make quick decisions inside one Notion workspace. This means you can access Jira, GitHub, and Slack from Notion to gain back time lost context switching.
For example, we know that many engineering teams use tools like Jira and Asana to manage their product roadmap, track bugs, see their backlog, create reports, and more.
----
But other teams outside engineering often don’t have insight into these statuses. Instead, they’re left to send Slack messages or emails, asking engineers if the work is complete. If you’re using a page in Notion to track the status of bug fixes and product updates for a project, ask your engineering team to post Jira link previews inside the page so other teams know exactly when issues are fixed.
This makes information more accessible to all, helping align teams without meetings, pings, or rooting around.
This allows teams to:
Build faster knowing the status of product features— when all information lives in Notion, that saves your team time from searching for information or statuses (so they can spend time building).
----
Build a granular project management system— unite all aspects of your project into a single project management system, so you’re not chasing around disparate pieces of valuable information.
Align with external collaborators— link previews gives external collaborators all the information they need to execute. Everyone is aligned on statuses and action items without needing to manage more access controls.
Understanding how Notion fits into your toolstack helps you get the most out of it.
----
Notion is great for async communication (and has been referred to as “the other half of Slack”) because of how you can organize and easily access information in documents. But Notion also pulls together all your other tools too — and when information lives in one place, it saves your team time searching for what they need to execute.
If you use tools for any of the following use-cases, you can consider consolidating them in Notion for a more connected workspace experience.

Use Notion’s Data Retention settings to keep your team compliant & restore content
Your company trusts Notion with its most important and confidential information. Thank you.
With the ability to set custom data retention settings in Notion, your team can now easily comply with your company’s requirements.
Whether you’re an IT professional setting up Notion for the first time, or just a contributor trying to be a good steward of your company’s data, it’s important to understand how different artifacts in Notion translate to your team’s specific policies.
----
For the majority of teams on Notion, you shouldn’t need to customize your data retention settings. However, there are a few reasons why you might want to consider setting custom retention settings. These include:
Meeting industry-specific regulatory standards —Data retention settings are important for compliance with industry-specific regulations, such as HIPAA for healthcare and GLBA for finance. These regulations often require that certain types of data be kept for a certain period of time, and failure to comply can result in significant legal and financial consequences. By implementing custom data retention settings, companies can ensure that they are meeting these requirements and avoiding any potential legal issues.
----
Internal data governance best practices —Your company might have specific standards across tools about how data should be retained. These can help reduce the risk of data breaches, reduce storage costs (in some tools), and ensure that data is only kept for as long as it is necessary. Furthermore, retention settings can help companies manage their data in a more structured way, making it easier to find and use the data they need.
----
Litigation & Legal Management —Data retention is also important for litigation matters because it can help protect the company from legal claims. By retaining data, companies can demonstrate that they have taken reasonable measures to preserve evidence and comply with legal requirements. This can help reduce the risk of sanctions or other penalties for spoliation of evidence.
Data retention in Notion
For more information about data retention in Notion, check outour help center article.
If you fall into one of the groups above, you will want to consider using custom data retention settings to keep your Notion use compliant. These settings dictate what happens to Notion pages after they’re placed in the trash.
----
If you’re not familiar with Notion, check out the following definitions before moving on:
Pages —Notion pages are where all of your content lives. These are roughly analogous to a document in a traditional word processing software. Pages you and your team are working on can be viewed in the sidebar in the left-hand side of your app.
Sidebar —The sidebar, located on the left hand side of the app, is your navigation hub for all things Notion. Its where youorganize, rearrange, and find your pages within your workspace. If pages are like documents, the sidebar is like your file manager.
----
Trash —This is where deleted pages live until they are “retained” (more on that later). You can find and sort through pages in the trash on the bottom left hand side of your sidebar.
A note on blocks
Blocks arethe way you build in Notion. Everything that sits on a page is a block including text, images, and tables. You can mix and match different blocks to create unique pages and tools for your team.
When blocks are deleted, they exist in page history, which is retained alongside the page itself.
When pages are deleted, they and all of their contents immediately move to the trash. Notion’s data retention settings dictates what happens to pages and their contentafterthey’re placed here.
----
There are three locations a document can be in after it is moved to the trash, and your data retention settings allow you to dictate how long pages stay in each of these locations.
Pages in trash —To start, pages that have been deleted will be stored in trash. As an Enterprise workspace owner, you have the ability to customize how long pages will stay in trash before they are deleted. The default is 30 days, but workspace owners can set this to be up to 10 years.
----
Retained pages (Deleted from trash) —After pages are deleted from trash (whether that’s done manually using the “permanently delete” button, or because they’ve reached their time limit), pages will enter a retention period. Again, the default here is 30 days, but workspace owners can set this to be up to 10 years.
Purged pages —Pages that have been deleted from the trashandhave passed their retention period are purged from the system and are not restorable by anyone.
Anyone that had access to a page can find and recover it from the trash using the left hand sidebar. This way, most of your Notion teammates can self-serve in the case of accidents.
----
As an Enterprise workspace owner, you can restore deleted pages once they enter the retention period.
Enterprise workspace owners can also use Content Search to find pages in the trash and restore them. To access Content Search, navigate to Settings and members in the left hand sidebar. You'll find Content Search under the Workspaces section.
Select Retained pages from the drop down menu and locate the page you want to restore.
For retained pages, pages that were deleted from trash and are still in the retention period, workspace owners can use the admin content search to find and restore them.
When you do this, you’ll find two options. Here’s how we suggest you use each:
----
Restore page to give access to other workspace members —This will restore a page to its original location, granting access back to those who originally had it. You’ll most likely use this in the case of accidents (because they can happen!) like unintended page deletions or provisioning errors.
Restore to your private pages to keep things confidential— This will move the page into your (the restorer’s) private page section,withoutgranting access to anyone else in your workspace. This can be handy when you need to restore pages behind the scenes, like in the case of a sensitive legal or HR matter.

Organize your everyday life with Notion AI
Getting your life in gear can feel overwhelming. You want to plan everything from your weekly meals to your next big trip, and maybe you’d love to push your career forward by updating your resume or redesigning your daily habits and goals.
You can do all that in Notion, and with AI, it’s even more intuitive and fun to set up systems to advance your life.
If you already organize aspects of your life in Notion, you can boost your productivity, creativity, and effectiveness by adding AI to your workspace.
In this guide, you’ll learn how to integrate Notion AI into your daily life to write, make plans, get inspired, take on new challenges, and achieve your goals.
----
But first, a quick overview of the technology behind Notion AI.
Notion AI works like any Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology:
It looks for patterns in a massive set of data, referred to as training data, to create a model
It tests its model by asking a question it already knows the answer to and analyzing how accurate its answer is. The data the AI uses here is called test data.
Over time and with more inputs and training data, it learns and iterates on the model
Using this process, Notion AI can generate text, brainstorm ideas, improve writing, translate, summarize, and much more. It considers all the data it has access to, plus the context of the page you're on, and produces text in response to your questions.
----
What’s special about Notion AI is that it’s built-in to your workspace. There’s no need to sign up for different tools and copy and paste responses from one app to another. You can call up Notion AI to help you with whatever you need without breaking your flow.
Rate AI content with thumbs-up or thumbs-down
As with all kinds of AI technology, responses can sometimes be inaccurate or misleading.Use the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to report great or not-so-great Notion AI responses. This helps our engineers improve the technology for everyone!You can read more about the limitations of AIhere.
To get started with Notion AI, go to a new line and press thespacekey.
----
Now you can input a prompt. You can ask for anything - try requesting a definition of a concept (such as AI), ideas about a topic, or an outline for a document.
Here’s a brief overview of some things Notion AI can do:
Create a summary of a long article or webpage— Ask AI to summarize the text from an article, and it will generate a short paragraph.
Extract themes from data, or create action items— Notion AI can consider all information on a page and produce key takeaways like the themes from articles, class notes, journal entries, or even a list of action items from your notes.
----
Turn bullet points into a fully-fledged doc— You can quickly turn a few messy bullets into a complete document with the help of Notion AI, which will fill in the gaps and expand on your ideas.
Improve your writing and grammar— Make your writing instantly better with Notion AI, which can fix spelling and grammar mistakes, improve your sentences and change your tone.
Generate text in a flash— No more staring at a blank page or struggling to get started when you want to write. Notion AI can generate text in seconds based on your prompts and refine and edit until you’re happy with your content.
So, what can you actually do with such a powerful tool at your fingertips? Next, we’ll look at some examples.
----
Planning your weekly meals in advance save you time and reduces daily decision-making.
Inside your Notion meal prep database, create a template for a new meal plan. Add a custom AI block to your template by going toInsert AI blocksin the/menu and choosingCustom AI block.
This AI block will produce text based on your instructions and take into account the other information on the page. So, any time you create a new database entry from your template, the custom AI block will be ready to go.
Here are some different ways you could use custom AI blocks:
----
Create a personalized weekly meal plan— In your AI block, explain that you want to generate weekly meals that incorporate the “Ingredients I have”, which you will list below. You can make your prompt more specific by asking for spicy recipes or meals that don’t contain nuts. When you clickGenerate, Notion AI will suggest recipes that fit your criteria.
Make a shopping list for your weekly meals— Once you’ve decided on your recipes, ask Notion AI to create a shopping list of all the ingredients youdon’thave for those meals. This will save you a ton of time drawing up your weekly grocery list, and make sure you only buy what you need.
----
Decide where to go for your next trip— You can use a custom Notion AI block to come up with some ideas for where to go on your next trip. Outside the block, define some criteria for your desired destination - such as climate, family-friendliness, or nightlife.
Plan travel activities— Once you’ve generated some destinations, you can ask Notion AI to recommend activities to do in each place. Customize the results by including your budget, length of stay, and fitness level in the prompt.
As well as custom blocks, you can use a Summary block to summarize the content of any page or an Action item block to pull action items from a page.

Plan your next trip with Notion AIhere.
Notion AI can help you write from scratch and turn a few messy bullets, notes, or ideas into a fully-fledged document.
You can use this to write resumes, cover letters, work emails, and anything else you can think of.
Here are some ways to write better with Notion AI:
Avoid the blank page and kickstart your writing— If you’re not sure where to start, ask Notion AI toHelp me write. Explain what kind of content you need to create and give plenty of details. For example, if you want to write a cover letter, explain the position, industry, and company you’re applying to.
----
Improve your rough draft— If you have an outline or draft, you can ask Notion AI to improve your writing, simplify technical words, expand on your ideas by writing more, or even change the tone to sound friendlier, more professional, or casual.
Write and rewrite until you’re happy with the result— Notion AI can rewrite some or all of the text to include new information or adjust the content in any way. You can say something like “Rewrite the opening sentence to sound more confident”, or “Give more details about my customer service experience”, or just ask Notion AI to change the tone.
Run a final spelling and grammar check— Notion AI can proofread your document before you send it off to make sure it’s free from typos or mistakes.
----
Everyone needs to produce well-written documents from time to time. Now, you don’t have to write from scratch or agonize over the wording of the cover letter before applying for a new role. Notion AI speeds up your writing process and helps you create perfectly crafted documents that convey precisely what you want to say.
You can use AI to expand your thinking and achieve more in any area of life
Notion AI will be your creative partner, helping you brainstorm ideas and turn them into action plans and results.
Here are some ways to achieve more in life with Notion AI:
----
Get help setting your annual or quarterly goals— Notion AI can help you brainstorm ideas for personal and professional goals. Write down all the things you’d like to change or achieve in your life. Then, create aCustom AI blockprompting Notion AI to suggest goals based on those criteria.
Create an action plan to achieve your goals— Once you’ve set some goals, you can ask Notion AI to generate an action plan of steps to achieve those goals, which you can customize accordingly.
----
Use AI as a tool for self-reflection— If you journal in Notion, you can use anAction itemsblock to extract tasks to do from your journal entries. You could also create a Custom AI block asking Notion AI to find common themes from your journal. This can help you better understand where you currently are and where you’d like to go in life.
Get personalized recommendations for books, movies, and music— Notion AI can generate personalized recommendations based on what you already love. Prompt AI to give you entertainment recommendations based on your favorites.
----
Decide on a daily routine or habits— Struggling to decide which habits you’d like to establish? Use a custom AI block to determine what habits to build based on your goals, lifestyle, and behaviors you want to cultivate.
You can generate almost any kind of content with AI just by writing a few great prompts and follow-up prompts.
The key is to include the three components of a good prompt:
Type of content— Explain what type of content you want to create, or choose an option from the dropdown menu. For example, an “email”, “project plan” or “recipe”.
----
Topic you want to cover— Include as much information in your prompts about the topic as possible. This is where you’ll explain that you want to send an email to your boss or create a project plan for your kitchen renovation.
Desired format— Tell Notion AI whether you want the results formatted in paragraph, bullet points, a table, or something else, and state the required length.
You’ll get better, more relevant  results from Notion AI with detailed and specific prompts.
If you're not satisfied with the initial output, don't worry! You can always ask AI to edit the text, improve writing, make it longer or shorter, make the tone friendlier, and more.
----
However, it's important not to over-engineer your prompts, as the whole point of using AI is to save yourself time.

Personal tasks
There are many ways you can build a personal tasks page in Notion to easily organize your life.
For example, you could create a simple checklist categorized into columns. Tasks can be moved between columns, and archived once completed.
Alternatively, try using a pre-built template from the template picker or theNotion Template Galleryto create a more advanced tasks page. Each task is its own page within a database, where you can add all the properties and detailed information you want.
You may decide to group your tasks by status, tags, or priority levels. You can also apply different views to your database—display your same data in a calendar, list, or table according to your needs.

Organize, manage, and track all your work with a personal dashboard
The best productivity system is the one that works for you.
But most software doesn’t allow you to customize it — you’re forced to shoehorn your system into a simple text list or cards on a Kanban board. What’s more, these apps probably live outside of where your team is working, so you have to bounce between multiple pieces of software to see what you need to do (then another to actually do it).
Using Notion, you can create a totally customized system that helps you organize, manage, and track everything you’re working on. And if your team is already using Notion, you can easily connect cross-functional work to your personal dashboard (we’ll show you how).
----
Here is everything you’ll need to build the optimal system for your own personal work dashboard in Notion.
At the core of every personal work dashboard is task management — how do we keep track of what needs to get done and when it needs to get done by?
The first step is to decide if you want to use a database. While databases are great for managing workflows with many parts, they might not be necessary for a simple list of to-do's. It all depends on the work you’re doing and and how you want to track it.
Usebasic blocksif:
You prefer simplicity & speed.
Your tasks are straightforward, and are more “did you do them or did you not?”
You like that satisfying feeling of checking things off your to-do list.
Use adatabaseif:
----
Your work has many parts — like a project that might require its own set of sub-tasks.
You need a way to organize tasks by sorting and filtering for specific properties.
You’re a visual person, and want to see you all your work laid out by priority level, due date, and more.
You care about being able to revisit work that was previously completed.
Our suggestion? Start simple and build on top of it. Begin with basic blocks, and if your processes require it, turn it into a tasks database.Keep in mind, the value your system delivers should always be greater than the work it takes to upkeep the system.
If you decide to start simple and use basic blocks to track your tasks, then the foundation of your system will be theto-doblock.
----
To create a to-do block, you can either type/to-door[ ]. The to-do block allows you to easily create a checkbox item, as well as give you the ability to satisfyingly cross things off as you go. From there, you can add a due date and set up a reminder for the task if you’d like (by using the@symbol).
Another helpful block for simple task management is the toggle block. To create a toggle, you can either type/toggleor>. The toggle block allows you to nest blocks within it so you can neatly track projects that may contain several tasks.
----
Hereis a template you can duplicate that’s built using basic blocks. We organized to-do blocks incolumnsby clicking the⋮⋮symbol to drag-and-drop text, which creates side-by-side sections. Alternatively, type/columnsto choose the number of columns you want to create. You can also drag-and-drop to move tasks from one column to another, or even to an “Archive” sub-page to keep a record of previously completed tasks.
If your tasks have several moving parts or dependencies, databases might be the better option for you. Databases allow you to filter, sort, and customize properties to manage tasks however you best see fit. But our advice still stands — keep things simple, and layer on functionality only if your workflow requires it.
----
We’ll start with a few pillars of a task management database that you can customize and iterate upon as you go.
If you need a quick primer on databases
Click to expand
Status— setting aStatushelps you keep track of exactly where the task is at. Simply add aStatusproperty to your database and you can choose from three default options: “Not started,” “In progress,” and “Done.” You can also customize these to be called whatever you want.
Date— by using theDateproperty, you can easily assign and track important dates for each task. The most common one we see is setting a due date for each task.
----
Select— theSelectproperty allows you to create and customize how you tag tasks in your database. Any tags you’ve created will show up as a dropdown list to choose from. We often see users leverage theSelectproperty to create tags for priority (High, Medium, Low) or the project type.
Database views give you the power to customize how you visualize your tasks and surface the information you need in an instant.
Table view— tasks are displayed in rows and their relevant properties are the columns. This is a great for getting a bird’s eye view of all your tasks in one place.
Calendar view— great for planning and seeing important dates, like the
Due dateof all your tasks at once (our marketing team loves this one for theircontent calendar).
----
Board view— allows you to group tasks based on properties, likeStatusorPriority. Users love the drag-and-drop functionality of the board view which allows you to seamlessly move a task from one status to another.
You can draw inspiration fromthis Tasks Databaseor duplicate it directly into your workspace. The template includes pre-built views of what we’ve outlined:
Board view organized by status
Board view organized by priority
Table view of all tasks
Calendar view of due dates
----
In addition to tracking your tasks, it’s also important that you’re able to contextualize how your work fits in with the rest of the organization. Notion makes it easy to add context from cross-functional teams as well as connect other tools directly into your personal work dashboard.
Having a through-line from your personal work to the company’s goals helps build alignment. You can see that what you’re doing directly rolls up into what the company wants to accomplish — and having them right in your personal dashboard can help bring focus to your work.
----
Type/linked view of databaseand select the source database you want to include. From there, you can use filters and sorts to customize further. For example, this company-wide goals database might have specific goals for marketing, sales, engineering, and more. But let’s say you’re on the engineering team. You can filter to only see the goals that engineering is responsible for.
When you create a linked database, remember that filters only apply to the linked database you created. However, any changes you make to the content or properties in the linked database will be reflected in the original database.
----
With the power oflink previews, you can bring all of your most important tools into Notion. Link previews allow you to see live, synced visualizations of links directly in Notion. This is currently supported by several major platforms (GitHub, Jira, Slack, Asana, etc.).
This gives live updates from other tools right inside your personal work dashboard — so you can build workflows with the most up-to-date information.
For example, you might have some work that’s dependent on an in-progress bug fix the engineering team is handling. You can paste a link from Jira right in your personal dashboard and see when that task has been complete, instead of needing to go into Jira and check the status of the bug fix.

How engineering and product teams use Notion for sprint planning
Engineering and product teams rely on sprints to get hyper-focused and ship new features and products by setting time-boxed goals to complete tasks.
You can set up and track sprints with Notion by combining projects, tasks, and sprint management. Your team’s project management system lives alongside all your documentation in a seamless, connected workspace where you have access to built-in AI to help you get more done, faster.
In this guide, you’ll learn:
How to get a ready-made template for sprint planning, project, and task management
Different ways to manage and automate your sprints in Notion
How to customize sprint management and connect other aspects of your work
----
Ways to use AI to accelerate your work
We’ve created an out-of-the-boxtemplatefor managing projects, tasks, and sprints with interlinked databases
To get this system in your workspace:
Add the template— Open the in-app Templates menu, and add the Projects, tasks, and sprints template to your team’s teamspace. You’ll now see 4 different views in your sidebar: Projects, Tasks, Sprints, and Sprint board.
Add some tasks and projects— Before you plan any sprints, start adding some tasks and projects in your new databases. You can fill out relevant properties and add tasks to their corresponding project.
Navigate to your “Sprint board” to manage tasks— Here, add tasks to your current sprint, update task progress and more.
----
Next, we’ll tour the template to show you exactly how it works.
These core concepts power Notion’s sprints solution:
Projects—  These represent larger chunks of work (sometimes called epics) and can be broken down into tasks. This could include things like a feature launch or redesign of your site or app.
Tasks— The individual tasks related to a specific project that typically have a single responsible owner. Tasks can be further broken down into subtasks to help the owner manage and prioritize work throughout a day or week.
Sprints— Sprints are related to tasks and act as a container to organize work across time.
----
Sprint board— Your sprint board shows you all the tasks you have to do in the current sprint, arranged by project and task status.
Databases power this solution
Notion databases are like digital filing cabinets, helping to organize your team's docs, meetings, tasks, and more. With special “relation” properties, you can seamlessly manage your work at any level of granularity and across any unit of time. Learn more about notion databaseshere.
The sprint planning template includes all you need to align your team and kick off sprints.
The Sprint board is your one-stop shop for sprint management. Here you’ll be able to view all tasks for your current and future sprints, grouped by status and project.
----
The default view of the Sprint board is filtered to show your current sprint.
This view will help you:
Focus on what needs to get done— This view filters out all tasks that don’t belong to the current sprint, eliminating distractions or confusion and helping you focus on what tasks are the highest priority.
See tasks grouped according to their project— Tasks in the Sprint board are grouped by the project they correspond to, so you can understand how much you have to do for each project and decide where to focus your energy.
Quickly add a new task— Click onNewto create a new task. If you click underneath the project you want to create a task for, your task will automatically be connected to that project.
----
Update a task status by dragging and dropping— When you start a task, drag it from theNot startedtoIn progresscolumn to update the status smoothly.
Visually track your progress with completion percentage— TheCompleted tasksproperty shows you the percentage of completed tasks for the sprint represented as a progress ring.
TheSprint boardalso contains two views for planning sprints.
See what’s next in sprint planning view— This Table view shows your tasks grouped by sprint. Here, see what’s coming up in the next sprint. You can move tasks forward to the next sprint, or add them to the backlog.
----
Review your task backlog— The Backlog view shows incomplete tasks that haven’t been assigned to a sprint. Here, add tasks to address later. Come back to this view when planning future sprints.
When you’re done with a sprint, click theComplete sprintbutton on the current sprint view to automatically move unfinished tasks.
When you click the button, you’ll be prompted to confirm the dates for your next sprint. Here you can decide whether to move unfinished tasks to your next sprint, send them to the backlog, or keep them in the current sprint.
For example, move high-priority, unfinished tasks to the next sprint, and put deprioritized tasks in the backlog. Tasks you no longer need to address can remain in the current sprint.
----
You never have to remember to create future sprints - this happens automatically when you complete your current sprint. This guarantees you always have an upcoming sprint and saves you from having to create one every time. Before you start a new sprint, you can adjust the start and end dates accordingly.
Notion’s Github workspace integration lets you link any Github pull requests with any task in Notion, and automatically shows the status of the pull request directly in your tasks database.
This integration helps teams collaborate smoothly and gives everyone — technical or not — visibility into work happening in other tools.
----
To set up the Github workspace integration, go toSettings & membersin your Notion sidebar. ClickMy connectionsand selectConnectnext to the Github (Workspace) app.
Find more detailed instructions for integrating Notion and Githubhere.
To link a pull request with one of your tasks:
First, create the task in your Notion tasks database.
Copy theUnique Task ID, which is automatically generated. This is how you will cross reference and link tasks in Notion and Github.
In Github, paste the Task ID into the title of the pull request
The pull request will now be linked in the Notion database entry, and a link will be available on the Github side. If you dont see it, try pasting the GitHub link into your new PR property.
----
You can also configure how you want theStatusproperty to update when the status of the pull request changes. Learn morehere.
You can have multiple status automations, meaning if you have one Merged PR (which would update the status property as complete) and you then link a second Open pull request, the Task will revert back to Open state. This is helpful if you need multiple pull requests to complete one task.
Locate tasks easily with a Unique ID
When you create a new task it will have an automatically generatedUnique ID.
Not only can this be used for linking and referencing to pull requests in Github - it can also help you locate database items faster.
----
Notion is flexible and fully customizable. You can add new properties, views and layouts so your team can view information in a variety of helpful ways. You can also use automation and AI to speed up your work.
View my sprint board —Duplicate the current sprint view and set a filter such that it only shows tasks for “Me.” Then save for everyone, so the view will show tasks assigned to whoever is currently logged in and viewing the database.
Assess team members’ workload— Group your team’s task database by Assignee to quickly review how much work everyone has on their plate.
----
Connect meeting notes and docs to project management— Use aRelationproperty to connect projects to relevant documentation. Then, the context behind your work will only be a click away. Learn about how to use relation propertieshere.
Automatically add new tasks with a button— Create abuttonanywhere in your workspace which can simplify work and complete multiple actions at once. For example, a “Create new task” button adds a new task to your database and fills out various properties simultaneously.
Notion AI is your built-in AI assistant that can help with all aspects of your work.
----
Your projects database comes with an AI Summary property which automatically generates a real-time summary of your project page content. You can add another custom AI autofill property to databases with your own prompt. Use this to:
Automatically write a user story— Ask Notion AI to write a user story based on information on your project page to help your team understand the problem they are solving for users.
Pull out risks and blockers from a project page— Notion AI can extract potential risks or blockers from your project page content and bring these to your attention as a database property. You could also ask to list out key results.
----
Brainstorm new product ideas— If you need to prepare ideas for an upcoming meeting, Notion AI can be your brainstorming partner. SelectBrainstorm ideasin the AI menu and explain what you want to come up with. You could even ask AI to help you come up with ideas for a feature name!
Draft a project plan— You can scope out a project plan in a few minutes using Notion AI. Ask Notion AI to help you write a project brief. It will generate a rough outline that you can customize and complete on your own or with more assistance from AI.
----
Write documents from scratch— Put together a first draft of any document in minutes - from feature specs to job descriptions. Ask Notion AI to help you write, edit, refine, and continue writing until you have a workable draft to share with your team.

Product teams nail cross-functional collaboration with these notes and docs templates
No one understands the value of trustworthy documentation better than product teams.
More than anyone, they're cross-functional and depend on collaboration with everyone from marketing and sales to engineering and design.
As a product leader, you need a single source of truth for all this disparate information — and a system to account for all the meetings and feedback comprising that truth.
----
In this guide, we’ll show you how to build two essential Notion setups tailored specifically for product teams — we'll call them Meeting Notes and Docs.We’ve seen these work across hundreds of teams to inspire a culture of documentation, in which information is collected, centralized, organized, and nothing is ever lost or missed.
Our step-by-step process for building Meeting Notes and Docs databases to house whatever information you need.
How you can customize and arrange these databases any way you like using properties, filters and sorting.
Tips and best practices from the Notion team specifically for product leaders to become more effective.
By the end, you'll be able to build both of these:
----
Product teams need a place to corral all the miscellaneous parts of their work. Whether it’s meeting notes where decisions are made, or a document where important brainstorming happens, organized documentation holds projects together.
Without a solid note-taking system in place, product teams might:
Lose track of what’s discussed in meetings— decision-making context, action items, and all the most important parts of a meeting won’t get remembered or executed.
Not be able to access important notes and documents— they’re scattered in different places, leading to duplicated work and operation without necessary context.
----
A lack of transparency in your org or company-wide— siloed notes and docs means siloed teammates who work without insight into what other PMs are doing.
Forget about your users’ needs— product teams are driven by solving their users’ problems. Projects can go off-track if that vision isn't documented somewhere central.
Remember, your product team can use Notion to organize all their most important information and manage projects
Click to expand
Building and implementing these two note-taking systems in Notion will help your team:
Collaborate more effectively— unite all teams on a project, no matter what time zone they’re in. Everything’s documented so no one misses important info relevant to their work.
----
Build foundational knowledge everyone can learn from— teams compound learnings when they can see all the context, edge cases and perspectives that factor into decisions.
Reduce distraction— cut down on the number of apps you use at once as Notion lets you take notes, collaborate, manage information and track progress in a single workspace.
Maintain consistent quality—documentation helps your team approach problems with the same set of criteria, helping to establish a process everyone follows for effective work.
Notion puts your notes and docs alongside your product team’s everyday work. This helps inform execution for every project from all teams involved.
We’ll show you how to create two resources with a single framework.
----
Notion has many different types of database views — galleries, calendars, tables, boards and lists. For now, we’ll start with a simple list database, but you can add more views later.
In your sidebar, click+to add a new page to your workspace. From there, you can selectListto turn your page into a list database.
Make two of these databases, one for Meeting Notes and Docs. If you’d like to make your databases stand out and easier to find, go ahead and select an emoji for your page. You’ll see that by default you have several blank pages in your list to start. Delete them or open one up to start editing it.
----
Your Meeting Notes database will organize all your meetings, from weekly syncs to those ad-hoc brainstorms with engineering about a difficult project.
Your Docs list will be where PMs can post project specs for feedback or share ideas for process improvements. They’re all in one place and easily found, making them useful for your entire team.
Notion databases are fully customizable so you can build the system that fits the way your team works.
----
Add properties— these are details about the items in your database. For instance, for meetings, properties can be added to show who attended, when the meeting took place, what team it involved, etc. Click thePropertiesmenu to add new ones. Just choose the type of properties you want (Person,Date,Select, etc.) and give them names. These will make it easy to filter and sort your database as needed.
----
Showing properties on your list— you can decide which properties you’d like to see in your list by clicking the properties menu and using the toggles to show or hide existing properties in the database. For example, in Docs you might want to see the type of doc and who created it. In Meetings, you might choose to see the date and time, the type of meeting, and who was there.
Creating filters— to add filters to your database, click onFilterin the database menu, and then+ Add a filter. Here you can filter your database to show only pages with certain properties. Use the drop downs to select the property and how you want to apply the filter. For example, in your Docs list, you can choose to only see docs where the type is “Spec."
----
Sorting your list— click onSortin the database menu. Choose the property you’d like to sort by. For example, sort your meetings by date by selecting theCreatedproperty and choosingDescendingto show the most recent meetings first.
Views— you can add multiple views to your database to arrange your information in different ways. Click+ Add a viewat the top left. Here you can create alternative views with different filters applied. For example, a view for only marketing meetings. You can change the type of database to board, table, calendar, etc. this way too, and toggle back and forth between different views in seconds.
Here are a few property recommendations just for product leaders using these databases:
----
Last edited time—this is useful for tracking progress and seeing the most recent updates.
Type of doc— using aSelectproperty, you’ll add all the different types of documents you create (technical spec, architecture overview, etc).
Status—aSelectproperty helps you assign a status to documents (in progress, for review, etc).
Reviewers—with aPersonproperty, tag anyone who needs to review the document.
Priority— assign a priority level with aSelectproperty. This will come in handy later if you want to arrange your docs in order of priority.
When the meeting took place—use theCreated timeproperty so you can see when a meeting was and organize your list with the most recent at the top.
----
Type of meeting— using aSelectproperty, add different types of meetings to choose from, like weekly stand-ups or bi-monthly syncs between product and design.
Meeting participants— with aPersonproperty tag, document everyone present in the meeting.
And here are some database views that product teams may find helpful:
What’s current— filter to see all documents tagged “in progress” or that relate to an ongoing project. For instance, documents where you're actively collecting feedback.
Doc type— set up views to see different types of docs, such as a view for all your technical specs and another for project proposals or research.
Where you’re tagged— only show docs or notes where you are tagged or you have action items to complete.
----
This week's meetings— a table view that's filtered to show only meetings from this week. HitFilterwhereMeeting dateandis withinandThe past week.
Your meetings— see all meetings that you’ve participated in or where you’re tagged and have follow-up tasks to complete.
High priority— only view high priority meetings. Add options like P1, P2 and P3 using aSelectproperty to indicate priority level and filter to see only P1s.
Calendar— add a calendar view to see all your upcoming or past meetings organized on the calendar.
With Notion’s custom properties and filtered views, you won’t have to wade through reams of data to find what you need. You can surface the information that is relevant to the task at hand.
----
It’s time to start adding some pages to your databases. Every page in your database can be structured however you want — a feature that's unique to Notion.
HitNewat the top right and an empty page will pop up on your screen. This is where you'll take your meeting notes or write documents.
Every Notion page is a blank canvas. You can add elements to it by hitting+in the margin or typing/to bring up your menu of choices. This is how you can add text, headings, bullets, checkboxes, and much more. Here are some key advantages:
----
Create headers— there are three different types of headers,H1(the largest),H2, andH3(the smallest). Use them to help you organize information. For instance, a set of meeting notes might have anH1header for “Action Items” withH2headers underneath for the different teams responsible for them.
Add media— Notion makes it easy to assemble images, videos, PDFs, files, quotes, recordings, and embeds from 500+ apps inside pages so they truly can be put to use however you need. Just drag what you want into the widow or hit/to find the right item.
----
Drag & drop— arrange and rearrange content in seconds using the⋮⋮icon. You can even create columns (the blue lines will guide you). You can also drag pages under headers and pages into other pages to nest them for further organization.
Given their flexibility, you can use Notion pages for all kinds of things.
In your Docs database, you might have an audio file from an interview you’ve done with a user discussing a new feature request. In your Meeting Notes database, might have an image of an app redesign you need to discuss with your design team.
All of these blocks come together inside Notion pages, so your team doesn’t have to leave your Meeting Notes or Docs database to get work done. Everything lives side-by-side.
----
Here are some embeds that are particularly beneficial to product teams
Click to expand
Now you see that you can create fully-custom, beautifully-designed pages in Notion. Once you create helpful page structures, you can replicate them easily with templates.
This will save time by instantly generating a new page created in the format you need, and this is a great way to standardize processes for taking meeting notes or creating certain types of docs.
Do you need your weekly meeting page to always have your quarterly goals at the top? Use a template. Want to make sure all your team’s product specs have the same criteria? Use a template. This makes everything efficient, clear, and unforgettable.
----
To create a template, click the arrow next to theNewbutton on the database. Select+ New template.
Now you’re editing a template. Anything you do here will be reflected every time you use the template. But don’t worry — you’re not stuck using it forever. If there’s something you notice that could make your template better, just update it. And whenever you use the template going forward, it’ll have your updated version.
Here are a few ideas for useful templates you could create:
Ad Hoc— for random, general meetings that may arise, add anH2header for “Discussion Points,” followed by anotherH2for “Action Items” with a to-do list underneath.
----
Weekly sync— for a weekly meetings template, addH2slike “Review of the past week,” “What we will do this week” and “Potential blockers.” These can all be followed by a bullet list. Then, a finalH2for “Action Items,” with a checklist.
Kickoffs— start with anH2“Overview,” and add some text underneath, for example, “What is the project, and why are we working on this?” Then, add otherH2s: “Problem Statement,” “Proposed Solution," “Success Criteria,” “User Stories,” “Scope.” Short prompts or questions under each heading will help you fill the page out quickly.
Sprint planning— for a meeting to plan a sprint, include headers like “Sprint Goal” to get clear on what you’ll accomplish, then “Spring Backlog,” “Team & Roles” and “Notes.”
----
Post-mortem—to analyze the outcome of a project, useH2sfor “User Facing Impact,” and “Timeline”. Under a header for “Relevant Metrics”, prompt people to paste in graphs or links to data. In the template, include leading questions that encourage you to dig deep into the root cause, and figure out how to prevent future incidents.
RFC— this stands for “Request for Comment,” and it’s a document we often use at Notion that invites teams to start a discussion about an idea. CreateH2ssuch as “Problem” where you’ll describe the issue you’re trying to solve, followed by “Context” to provide some background information, “Proposed Solution” and “Action Items.”
----
Technical Spec— your product team can use a technical spec every time you start a project to state product requirements before development begins, without missing a detail. In your template, includeH2slike “Summary,” “Background,” “Goals” and “Non-Goals” to get clear on what you will, and won’t, achieve. Then, add a section to propose solutions, breaking down the risks, milestones and open questions.
Architecture Overview— you’ll use this template any time you want to document specific software features and get aligned with engineers regarding any changes that need to be made. Include headers to describe the feature and its purpose, plus the client, server, and database.
----
Now, when it’s time for the team’s weekly sync or sprint planning meeting, just clickNewat the top right of your database and select the corresponding template. Then you’ll be ready to jump straight into planning the meeting and recording the outcomes, saving you and your team time.
In Notion, you can have the same database appear across a number of different pages. You can have your original database, and then a series of what we call "linked databases" elsewhere showing whatever view of the original you want.
For example, you can have your original Meeting Notes database for your company, and then — on your marketing wiki — have a version of that same database showing only meeting notes tagged "marketing.”"
----
Create linked databases anywhere in your workspace by typing/linkedand selectingCreate a linked database. Then, you’ll choose the database you require, and your information will now appear as an in-line table inside the page.
Add the necessary filters to make sure your linked database only shows the information relevant to the page you’re in. For example, in the homepage for the project you’re launching next week, add a linked database which is filtered to show only meeting notes relevant to that project.
----
You can use this linked database to easily add new project notes, which the entire company can see in the original database if they want. At the same time, you don't have to distract your project team with all company-wide notes. Everything syncs seamlessly!
Of course, we here at Notion use Notion for our Meeting Notes and Docs systems. They help our product team stay aligned with all the cross-functional work they’re doing, and keep everyone updated on necessary information.
To help you use your Meeting Notes and Docs databases to their full potential, here are a few best practices from our team.
----
Connect your notes and docs to your projects— using aRelationproperty, you can connect Docs and Meeting Notes to yourproduct team's project database. That way, everything related to a project is in one place. You can see why a decision was made on a project by looking through the old meeting notes associated with it. How to do ithere.
Use backlinks to see where Meeting Notes or Docs pages are shared— if you’re sharing Meeting Notes or Docs elsewhere in Notion between teams, backlinks give you a map. You can see where a specific page has been shared, and where it hasn’t. This helps your team easily navigate all related work. More info on backlinkshere.
----
Create a culture of documentation— requiring that decisions, meetings, etc. all be documented helps your team learn collectively and onboard more easily. As a company, Notion actually has only one Meeting Notes database and one Docs database, and all teams use these two resources. That way, everyone in the company can see what individual teams or people are up to, and teams can use more granular views and linked databases to focus on what's relevant to them.

The best ways to use simple tables in your Notion pages (and when not to)
Simple tables leave you to do what you do best — think. There are times that a database, with so much functionality, can feel like a power drill when a screwdriver would actually make doing the job easier.
Simple tables let you create columns and rows. Display important text. Add headers. And that’s just about it. Because sometimes, that’s all you need.
Here we’ll walk you through a few use cases for simple tables and discuss scenarios in which you might be better off with a database.
----
Simple tables make yournotesanddocumentationricher and easier to read. They let you display plain text visually to help get your point across to readers (or your future self) in a clear and efficient manner. Just like callouts draw attention to text and bullets are used to parse info, simple tables are great for collecting and organizing bits of related information.
To add a simple table to your page:
Type/tableand select the first option.
Drag outwards to add additional columns, or down to add additional rows.
Once your simple table is created — just click into cells, and use thetabkey to navigate horizontally as you add content.
Read more about simple tables in our help center
Click to expand
----
When you're looking to distill information in an easy-to-read format, try simple tables. In these instances, databases can feel overwhelming to the reader and the depth of information structure doesn't provide an additional benefit. For example, if you’re reporting metrics in a meeting, you can use a simple table to focus on the data at hand.
Label information with headers —use theOptionsmenu to toggle on row and column headers for additional visual distinction in the form of a colored header background and bolded header text.
Display side-by-side with other blocks —when context is needed for what’s inside a simple table, drag and drop it next to any other block type in Notion.
How to organize your meeting notes
Click to expand
----
Similarly, you may want to use simple tables in team documentation to emphasize key pieces of information. It can be easier to digest for the reader than other basic blocks, especially when several pieces of information are related.
For example, in the case of data reporting you could consider including data definitions for important metrics. Here you could follow the same flow to add a simple table — toggle on the column header option, and start adding content! Simple tables in documentation don't have to be stagnant. Here are just a few features to help keep your work dynamic:
----
Add and insert rows and columns —if at any point you need to insert content, like a new definition, use the row and column handles to add above, below, right, or left!
Maximize space on the page —use the←→option to snap your database to page or column width and further draw reader's attention to the information. This is especially helpful after you've added a column, to reset the width of your whole table.
In both of these use cases, we're just dealing with displaying and reporting information, without the need to further organize, tag, or calculate anything. That's a good way to think about simple tables in general — just the text, none of the fancy stuff.
----
In addition to making documents and notes richer, simple tables can be good for ideation before committing to a full database structure. This is great when you want the flexibility to quickly iterate in a discussion or brainstorm, and sets you up to easily convert your information to a database later on.
Let's consider the example of planning an offsite for your team — throughout the day you'll have lots of different sessions, speakers, etc. In the long run, this will be a great use case for a database, but when you want to put pen to paper, a simple table is best and here's why:
----
Collaborate with inline comments —since simple tables just store plain text, all of Notion's collaboration tools, including inline comments, will work as expected. You can mention team members and have full discussions, right on your main page.
Want to learn more about collaboration?
Click to expand
Drag and drop rows and columns as needed —the flexible text structure means that you can easily move columns around in a way that makes sense to you and your team. For offsite planning, use this to arrange sessions in order after you've brainstormed.
Delete rows that are no longer needed —plans change, and in the startup world they change quickly. Easily remove the contents of a row using the row handle.
----
Think of simple tables like the collection of post-it notes in your home office — informative for small bits of information, and eye catching — but they don't scale. Simple tables are to post-it notes as databases are to bullet journals and nicely bound planners. Use databases for yourprojectsandtasks, or asrepositoriesfor big collections of notes & docs.
While simple tables let you quickly visualize information, you should consider converting to a database anytime you are wanting to filter or sort through said information. To do this, use theTurn into Databaseoption in the table menu.
----
In the case of our offsite planning example, you may consider converting your table to a database once all parties have signed off on the schedule, and you're ready to use pages in a database to plan sessions. This will give you tons of additional functionality, including:
Add date properties to map the day on a timeline —databases can have multiple views, which means you can display them in different ways — including on a timeline or calendar.
Open rows to a full page to add speaker notes and details —unlike simple tables, database rows can open to new Notion pages where you can store important information related to the topic of the row.
----
Add additional properties for task management —your events have a speaker, room assignment, and a lot more. Add properties to keep track of these details.
Sort and filter events —once your properties are in place, filter based on the person assigned for facilitation, or sort by time and date.
Generally speaking, databases are differentiated in that they allow you to open each entry as it's own page, add functional tags (dates, people, URL, and more), create relationships, rollups, and formulas, and display data in different views (lists, timelines, calendars, boards, and galleries).
Using databases for note taking?
Click to expand
----
We've got tons of resources detailing database use cases, but generally speaking it's a good idea to skip the simple table altogether when you need to capture multiple, categorical pieces of information about each item, like asales CRM.
If you're hoping to create integrations — like with Slack or any 3rd party no-code tool, databases are a better option from the get-go. In the case of the CRM, here's an exampleintegration that automatically adds rows to your database when your team creates a new contact in salesforce. While we won't go into additional detail on these features here, it should be clear that they're the more exhaustive option.
Here are some of Notion's favorite database use cases

Sprints, simplified with Notion’s sprint tracking system
Sprints are a component of the Agile methodology, allowing engineering and customer experience teams, in particular, to manage work clearly, time block tasks, and ship new features faster.
When you already manage projects and tasks in Notion, having to use another tool for sprints just adds complexity.
Instead, include sprint management in your Notion project & tasks for a fully connected and transparent system to create and assign new tasks, link them to projects, and organize your team’s sprints.
This guide will cover:
Adding Sprints to your projects and tasks system
Using Notion to coordinate sprint planning, execution, and retrospectives.
----
If you’re starting your Notion project management system from scratch, go to theTemplatesmenu in the sidebar and addProjects, tasks, & sprintsto your workspace.
Alternatively, if your system is based on the Projects & tasks template, you can add sprints as an additional layer on top of your existing databases.
To do this:
Go to your Tasks database.
Open the options menu…at the top of the database.
SelectSprints, thenTurn on sprints.
This will create a third database called Sprints, linked to your Tasks database by a relation property. A Sprint board will also appear in your sidebar.
Now, you can connect tasks to sprints and manage them in the Sprint board.
Sprints can only be added to a Tasks database.
Click to expand
----
With Notion, all your team’s tasks, projects, and sprints are connected seamlessly. You can also conveniently link back to the meeting notes, documents, and context that informs your work.
Here’s a look at how to plan and execute sprints in Notion.
Start your kick-off meeting in the Sprints database and open Sprint 1, which will be tagged asCurrentin theSprint statusproperty.
If needed, adjust the start and end dates according to when your sprint should begin and how long it will last. You can do additional planning here by using thePlanning notestoggle to take notes or record goals for the sprint.
----
Next, go to the Sprint planning view of the Sprint board. If this is your first sprint, all tasks will be in theBacklogand not assigned to any sprint.
Review all the outstanding tasks in this view, and when you want to assign a task to the current sprint, go to the Sprint property and select Sprint 1. To speed up this process, use the checkbox on the far left column to select several tasks and drag them into Sprint 1.
Once tasks are assigned to the sprint, you can view them conveniently in the Current view of the Sprint board. This kanban layout shows all your tasks organized according to status.
During the sprint, team members will come here to move their cards across and update status of tasks.
----
If new tasks need to be added, you can do this directly from the Sprint board. Click + in the New category to add a new task and assign an owner.
Sprints typically end with a retrospective, where you meet with your team to analyze the success of the sprint and decide what should be done with any incomplete tasks.
Notion’s Sprint system enables you to review your progress and ensure no tasks slip through the cracks when you move on the the next sprint.
To complete a sprint:
Go to theCurrentsprint view of your sprint board.
ClickComplete sprint.
----
A dialog box will appear giving you the option to adjust the start and end date of your next sprint, and choose whether you want to move incomplete tasks to the next sprint, to the backlog, or keep them in the current sprint.
When you clickComplete Sprint 1, this sprint will become a Past sprint and Sprint 2 will be assigned as the Current sprint.
Engineering and customer experience are two teams with a lot of tasks on their plate that need an efficient system to power through work and track the completion of tasks.
Sprints in Notion is a convenient way to organize tasks, where you can clearly measure the successes of each sprint, and work that didn’t make it.
Here are some ways sprint planning is simplified in Notion:
----
Automate your sprints— Turn on automated sprint completion and creation to cut out manual steps and efficiently manage the work across your team. Go toSprintsin the options menu and toggle onAutomated sprints.
Customize sprint start and end times— In the sprint options menu, you can choose the default duration of sprints and which day you want new sprints to begin.
Analyze sprint success— Your Sprints database shows the percentage of completed tasks per sprint as a progress ring. Compare each sprint side by side to track your efficiency over time.
Get a linear view of past, present, and future sprints—The timeline view of theSprintsdatabase shows how sprints intersect.
----
See the context of tasks in a few clicks— Tasks are linked to Projects by a relation, which means you can quickly see the larger initiative each task corresponds to and bring up helpful information and context.
Send Slack notifications when a sprint is completed— Database automations can be added to your Sprint database. For example, you could send a Slack notification to your team channel when a sprint is completed and a new one begins.

Start fresh and do the thing: How to actually set and hit team goals this year
Much like setting personal resolutions, achieving your team’s goals is all about creating a system — one that makes it super clear which projects help achieve those goals. High-output teams often get so head’s down in execution that they lose sight of the bigger picture.
In Notion, you can develop a system that breaks down goals into actionable projects. These projects all get owners and deadlines, but there’s also clarity about which goals they support, both company- and team-wide.
Because planning and execution live side-by-side, Notion can give your team actionable granularity with important perspective.
----
Using this setup, you’ll soon have a goals tracker that looks like this:
Having this context is like putting a pair of glasses on your team — it brings everything into focus, helping you prioritize and execute with transparency.
Normally, company goals are buried in a document somewhere, separate from the work your team is doing. Notion unites company goals, team goals, and the work that supports them, centralizing your most vital information.
Here’s how we think about it: projects → initiatives → team goals → company goals.
After establishing both company and team goals, we suggest making two databases: one for your team’s roadmap and another for the projects that’ll accomplish those goals.
Here’s how:
----
Create aTablethat’s for your team’s initiatives (this can be a page in yourteam's wiki). Call it “Roadmap.”
Create a column called “Company Goals” using aMulti-selectproperty, where each is a company goal. Do the same thing but this time, with “Team Goals.”
Every row in the table will be its own initiative, each correlating to both company and team goals. For example, if your company goal is to increase revenue, your team goal could be to acquire more leads. The initiative might be to establish a referral program.
Assign each of your initiatives a company goal and a team goal. This creates a line of sight from your team’s work all the way to the company’s goals.
----
Now create a secondTable. This will be for your team’s projects, so call it “Projects.”
Think about which specific projects can help accomplish these larger initiatives. For your initiative of establishing a referral program, projects might include: new email designs, creating an incentive structure, and establishing baseline metrics for success. Make each row in the table its own project.
Now you’re going to connect these two databases — so you can see all your goals, initiatives, and projects together. In your Roadmap, create a newRelationproperty. Locate your Projects database. Now you can begin assigning projects to the initiatives they support.
----
Whenever you create a new project, simply add it to your Projects database — where you can assign it an initiative. That way, it’ll automatically show up in your Roadmap too, so everything your team needs is in one place.
Actionable work has clear owners and timelines. When teams jump between calendar apps, project management and work tools, things slip through the cracks. With Notion, your team can see everything in one place, putting the focus on execution.
Properties help organize all the work you’re doing. Here’s how you can use them in each of your databases:
In your Roadmap:
Add aPersonproperty and assign an owner for each initiative.
----
You can add aSelectproperty to assign a priority to all the goals. That way, you can prioritize what’s most important first.
Use anotherSelectproperty to assign statuses to your goals, like “Blocked,” or “In progress,” or “Punted.”
So you can see what’s happening each quarter, createMulti-selectproperties (Q1, Q2, etc.). Because initiatives are bigger than projects, they may span multiple quarters.
In your Projects:
Add aPersonproperty and call it DRI (directly responsible individual), assigning one person to each project. You can also create a secondPersonproperty where you can tag anyone who the DRI is working with on that project.
----
With aDateproperty, you can designate a target launch date for each project. You can get even more granular by assigning each project an execution timeline. Add anotherDateproperty and this time, toggle onEnd date.
Use aSelectproperty for the status of your project. These can be things like “Not started,” “Planning,” or “Done.”
You can further categorize your projects using anotherSelectproperty to assign a “Type” to each one. These can be things like “Launch,” “Email campaign,” or “Team-building.”
----
Having these properties in each of your tables gives you an instant download of what your team is working on — and everyone has clarity into what each other is working on. Goals give that high-level look. Projects get a little more granular. And because both are connected, you get a full line of sight across your entire organization — timelines, owners, and the goals you’re working toward. This is great for building a culture of transparency and self-serve information.
Setting a yearly plan can feel a bit intimidating. But custom views of your Roadmap and Projects databases give you the ability to bucket this information — whether that’s projects you’re working on this week or initiatives for the entire quarter.
----
Custom database views allow your team to focus on what’s important now, while maintaining that broader level of transparency for bigger initiatives or team-wide goals.
Here are some views for your Roadmap:
A filtered view for each person on your team, so they can see all the initiatives they’re responsible for (and the related projects) in one place. This is especially helpful for reviews or planning sessions.
ABoardthat organizes all your projects by status, so you can see what’s in-flight — or if anything is blocked.
Tableviews for each quarter, so you can see all the goals, initiatives, and projects and when they’re being executed, like “Q1 Roadmap” through “Q4 Roadmap.”
And some views for your Projects:
----
ABoardthat’sGrouped bythe DRI, so you can see how many projects each person on your team is responsible for.
If your team has sub-teams — like the content team or the product marketing team — create views just for them, filtered to only see their projects.
ATimelineview to see the execution scope for projects. After you’ve made the timeline view, hit the•••button on the top right, and selectTimeline by. This will give you the option to choose which date you’d like to organize your timeline by — which will be your project timeline property (not deadlines).
ACalendarof all your launch deadlines, so you can see what’s set to launch whenever.
----
In your Projects database, templates can help ensure you’re approaching projects with the same set of criteria and process every time.
Launches, design specs, growth projects — they can all have their own templates with unique requirements so teams aren’t re-inventing the wheel every time they start a project. This streamlines your process and puts the focus on execution, allowing everyone to move forward with confidence, knowing edge cases are accounted for.
----
Remember: any item in a Notion database is a page that can be modified any way you want. Templates give you the structure to establish a repeatable process or surface common needs, but these pages are also customizable, flexible enough to be anything your team needs to accomplish their work.
To make a template in your Projects database, hit the bluevarrow next toNewon the top right corner. Then select+ New template.
Another great thing about templates? They can be updated whenever. If you learn something new or uncover a better process, update your template and take those learnings forward.

----
When goals are visible, all work gets put into perspective. If you ever wonder about taking on an initiative, think: “Does this roll up into my team’s goals?”
Same goes for reviews. Whether it’s weekly, monthly, or quarterly, conducting consistent reviews helps your team assess their work and improve going forward.
Using Notion, you can link to your Roadmap or Projects databases with specific views relevant to certain pages. For example:
----
In your weekly 1:1s with direct reports, link a view of the Projects database showing only their projects for the quarter. Put this in your 1:1 template so it’s included automatically every week. This is really useful for check-ins, questions, prioritization, and status updates on the report’s work. And if you mark a project as complete, it’s reflected in your master Projects database.
If you’re hosting quarterly reviews, you can link a view of the Roadmap so everyone can see what’s been accomplished that quarter. These reviews help shape your planning, with that hindsight providing invaluable foresight.
----
Align cross-functional teams. If your marketing team constantly collaborates with your sales team, you can create a view of the marketing Roadmap just for sales that lives in their wiki — so they can see all work relevant to them.
In your team wiki (or company wiki!), it’s helpful to see all the work in motion for a specific week. This promotes transparency. Link a view of your Projects database at the top of your wiki, filtered by launch date — so no one misses anything important.
Setting clear goals puts your team’s work into focus. It’s easy to get off track and lose that focus — but this system maintains the thread between the day-to-day and the big things you want to accomplish.
----
It’s also extremely flexible, for when, inevitably, things come up along the way. As targets move, goals shift, and priorities change, you and your team will be ready.
Whether it’s the beginning of the year or the start of a new quarter, planning is a great time to rally your team around goals and how to accomplish them. Notion brings your team together to do this in one place.

The status property gives you clarity on task progress
Notion databases now have a purpose-built status property for assigning status to your projects or tasks. For every project, you get a clear view of what needs to be done, what’s completed, and what’s dependent on another task being completed first.
Choose from one of three categories: To Do, In Progress, or Complete, and create as many sub-categories as you need. In this guide, we’ll show you how project managers can design a custom workflow with enough constraints to maintain clarity without sacrificing meaningful definitions that make life easier for you and your team.
----
When multiple people are working on a project, you need standard status definitions to keep everyone on the same page. If you have too many similar categories, different categories on different projects, and crossover between those categories, it’s hard to understand what’s actually going on.
If everyone's using their own definitions, you lose accuracy. You have to spend time deciphering the difference between a project that’s "In Progress" versus one that’s "Started." And what about that project tagged “Waiting”? Does that mean waiting to start, or is it dependent on another project?
----
Notion's dedicated status property can help clear up this confusion and make it easier to set up a standardized system for your team. In a few clicks, project managers can set up an easy way to see where everyone’s at with ongoing work. All your projects will fall into one of three overarching categories: To Do, In Progress, or Complete, and you can create custom sub-categories to give more context and specifics.
As a project manager, you don’t have time to deliberate over the details of the projects database. In Notion you can create a functional projects database from scratch and have it up and running in just a few clicks. Add properties to record the most important information, and customize the database as needed.
----
The status property comes pre-loaded with the three most important tags. You can then customize as you go to add details that will help you manage your team’s work more effectively.
When it comes to project status, creating a standard set of options up front can make the true status of projects clearer.
Until this point, most Notion users have been using aSelectproperty to create different project status options. They may have usedMulti-selectto give more specific information, so you could tag a project as both "In Progress" and "Waiting for Update."
----
The problem here is that anyone can just type in a whole new category, without knowing that a similar one already exists. It quickly gets confusing when everyone has too much freedom, and therefore room for inconsistency.
It’s time-consuming to create categories unnecessarily, over and over again, and overlapping categories can be open to interpretation. Plus, filtering the database is trickier, as you need multiple filters to include all the definitions. If you miss one, your view of a project’s status is compromised.
The status property gives you more constraints, less confusion.
----
In a few steps, you can set up a simple project workflow for your team. You can get granular by creating multiple tags to label the various stages to take a project from In Progress to Complete.
You won’t lose sight of the bigger picture, as you’ll know exactly how many projects are underway, what’s in the pipeline, and which ones are done and dusted.
To add a status property to your projects database, simply follow the steps below:
Go to your projects database.
Click on the…for database options.
Go toPropertiesthen click+ New property.
InType, selectStatus.
To add your own custom status tags, selectAdd statusunderneath To-do, In Progress or Completed, and type in your new sub-category. You can’t change the three main categories.
----
You can choose whether you want to display the status like a select property, or as a checkbox. The checkbox will show everything in "To Do" as unchecked.
The status property comes pre-loaded with common categories, but you might find it useful to add your own sub-categories, such as:
In the Pipeline — an idea or proposal that may go ahead in the future, but is not a priority.
Up next  — Prioritize projects in your backlog.
Blocked — the project can't go ahead until a problem is fixed.
In review — when you’re waiting for sign-off so the project should start.
1st Draft, 2nd Draft, Editing — the different stages of creating a piece of content.
With (team member) — this shows you who's currently working on the project.
----
Waiting — a project that can’t progress until you get approval or further information.
Ready to Publish — lets you know that the project is ready to finalize.
Published — for all projects that have gone live.
Filtering databases is the best way to view contextual information and avoid overwhelm. The status property makes filtering your projects database easier and more efficient than ever.
To create a database view showing all projects that are currently in progress:
Go to your database, and selectAdd view.
Give your view a name, such asIn Progress.
In your new view, clickFilter, and choose the status property.
Filter by StatusIn Progress.
Now, you have a database view showing all your ongoing projects.
----
You can also create a board grouping all your In Progress projects by their sub-category.
Create a new database view. This time, selectBoard.
Filter the database by Status and selectIn Progressjust like before.
Go to options, (...) selectGroup,Group by, and choose Status. Then clickSortand selectManualto be able to drag your categories into the desired order.
You can toggle onHide empty groupsto keep the database view looking neat.
And there you have it — a board, filtered to show all ongoing projects, grouped by their status sub-category. You can easily see how many projects are near to completion, and which ones still have a way to go before they’re wrapped up.

Structure your sidebar for more focused work with teamspaces
Your company workspace is made up of various teamspaces where each department, team, project or interest group stores relevant docs, wikis, notes, and project trackers.
Teamspaces give everyone a place to get work done, and make it easier to find relevant information. For example, you can get straight to where the docs, notes and databases related to engineering live, without getting caught up in another team’s work along the way. What’s more, you can customize which teamspaces and pages show up in your sidebar, and where, so that its perfectly suited to your working needs.
When you’re able to find what you need, you can settle in faster and accomplish great work every day.
----
Teamspaces are sections of the workspace where you’ll collaborate with your team and share relevant information and ideas. They help keep your Notion sidebar organized, so you’ll spend less time digging through disorganized files and untitled pages, and more time focussing on what matters.
This guide will be your introduction to teamspaces and how they work.
You can join teamspaces for teams, offices, cross-functional projects - even common interest groups! Once you’ve joined these teamspaces, their documents will always be easy to access. There’s no limit to how many teamspaces you can join, but, to maintain a clean workspace, only join teamspaces that are useful in your day to day work.
----
You can view information in some teamspaces without joining, and synced blocks can be helpful when you need to pull a small piece of information across teamspaces.
Here are some examples of teamspaces you’ll join:
The whole company— Everyone in the organization will belong to one teamspace, by default, which might be called something like “General.” This is where you’ll find company-wide information such as benefits information, vacation policy, mission, vision, values, and more.
----
Your department— Whether you work in marketing, engineering or sales, you’ll join a teamspace for that department where you can collaborate with your teammates and find information that relates to your everyday work. This will be the area of the company workspace where you spend most of your time.
----
Current projects— Collaborating with a cross-functional group on a feature launch, a marketing campaign or a website redesign? The project lead might create a teamspace where everyone involved in that project - engineers, designers, marketers and managers - can come to find information about the project, and actually do the work that’s required. These teamspaces may be archived once the project is over, so they won’t clutter up the workspace, but the content will always be there for reference.
----
Your office— It’s helpful to have a place to connect with the teammates you share an office with, even if you all have diverse roles in the company. The teamspace for the London office might contain information that’s specific to that location -  local holidays, guest protocol, meeting room calendar, etc.
Employee resource and interest groups—  Connect with fellow “LGBTQ @ your company,” “Women @ your company,” or other affinity groups through teamspaces. Plus, if you’re joining the company book club or fantasy baseball league, you might find all the resources related to your hobby stored in a dedicated teamspace. Not only does this help you find and share relevant information, but it also keeps it separate from your daily workload.
----
To browse all existing teamspaces, just go toAll teamspacesin your sidebar menu. All the teamspaces you’re currently a member of will show up underYour teamspacesand others will appear underMore teamspaces.
There are three types of teamspaces:
Open— Anyone can join an open teamspace, and you can view the content even if you aren’t a member. To join, all you have to do is hover over the teamspace and clickJoin. Alternatively, if you’re viewing a page in an open teamspace, clicking on the teamspace name in the breadcrumb will give you the option to join.
Closed— Teamspaces that are set to closed will appear in your sidebar under
----
More teamspacesand they’ll show up with an open padlock next to their name. You won’t be able to join unless a team owner invites you - they can do this in the teamspace settings & members menu.
Private— You won’t see private teamspaces unless you’re a member of that teamspace. A teamspace might be private because it relates to sensitive information, for example, the People team might use a private teamspace to collect employee feedback.
Speed up your navigation in Notion by customizing your sidebar. Keep pages you visit frequently in your favorites, and arrange your teamspaces according to how frequently you access their content.
Here are a few tips for organizing your sidebar:
----
You’ll probably start your day in your department’s teamspace, so you can keep it at the top of the list with its toggle open. You can keep this teamspace toggle open, so that it’s always easy to dive straight into the page you need.
The same goes for teamspaces for project-specific, cross-functional teams you form a part of.
Some teamspaces, like General, you might not need to access as frequently. Collapse those teamspaces’ toggles and move them farther down the list in your sidebar, so they aren’t getting in the way of daily navigation.
You can use the star icon at the top of any page to pin it to your sidebar.
----
Regardless of which teamspace the page lives in, pages that you pin will appear at the top of your sidebar under Favorites. We recommend adding just a handful of pages to your favorites, to avoid having too many scattered pages in the sidebar where you can’t see the teamspace they belong to.
You can still create private and shared pages in your workspace if you only need to give access to a few people, for example, the notes from your 1:1 meetings with your line manager.
These shared pages are easy to find - they’re filed underSharedin your side bar.
With synced blocks, you can copy over any Notion block from one place to another. Any time you make a change to the information in one place, it will update everywhere.
----
This makes it simple to keep information updated across teamspaces, and have those updates automatically distributed. By avoiding having to copy and paste information each time, you can reduce work and ensure information is kept accurate in all locations.
In open teamspaces, you can create synced blocks so that the same information can appear in two or more places at once.
For example:
Don’t miss important company-wide announcements— Updates that affect the whole company might be created in the “General” teamspace. Put a synced copy of the announcements block in your team’s weekly meeting notes, and you’ll always be on top of the most recent updates.
----
Make project work visible everywhere— For your cross-functional projects, synced blocks provide transparency for your team and manager into what you’re working on - even if the work you’re doing is in a different teamspace. Add them to your 1:1 docs, your personal tasks homepage, or your weekly team standup doc.
View top-level goals that impact your work— Company goals that live in the “General” teamspace might be particularly relevant to a project or goal your team is currently working towards. Bring those company goals into your team’s project area with a synced block, so you always keep the “why” of what you’re doing top of mind.
----
Search is a useful tool for finding any page, but if your search brings up the entire company’s documents, it can take a while to scan through all those pages. Filtering by teamspace can help you cut through to what you’re looking for quickly.
To search for a page, click Search at the top of the sidebar, and start typing out the name of the page you’re looking for (or any words or phrases in the page content.) To filter your results by teamspace:
Click Show filters to bring up the filter menu
Choose criteria to filter by. You’ll the option to filter by teamspace
When you’ve selected the relevant teamspace, you’ll see that your search results are filtered to only include pages belonging to that teamspace.
----
You can also select Ask AI to use Notion AI to search for content.

Switch from Confluence to Notion with our easy importer
If you’ve been dreaming of Confluence alternatives, you might feel like Branch.io Co-founder Dmitri Gaskin:
“In Confluence, our documentation was spread over a number of different spaces and hard to find. With Notion, it’s all in one place as a single source of truth.”
When documentation is inaccessible, it’s unusable. Think about all the documentation in your wiki that’s core to your company and its workflows — your mission, processes, decision logs, meeting notes, and so much more. All that is too important to be trapped in a tool no one wants to use.
----
Now, you can easily move your entire Confluence workspace over to Notion. This turns your wiki into a single tool that unites your project management system, notes, and shared docs.
The result: time saved, greater transparency and alignment, and more productivity — all while you pay for fewer tools.
Rigid wiki software turns vital information into a knot of documents no one at your company can untangle.
“Our Confluence wiki was a mess. Different teams would update different things. No one knew what was usable,” says Mixpanel Engineering Manager Vijay Iyengar.
Notion combines the flexibility to update information that specific teams crave with the structure managers, HR and people ops teams need to maintain consistency.
With Notion, you can:
----
Build pages and edit information easily— for non-technical teams, creating pages in Confluence can be intimidating and time-consuming. Notion’s user-friendly interface makes it easy for more teams and individuals to contribute and communicate.
Connect all your work seamlessly— don't just link out to your work in scattered, siloed apps. Notion puts it all in the same place. Your documents can live next to project specs, within one click of benefits and your product roadmap. Easy access, team-wide transparency.
----
Create custom workflows— software shouldn't shape the way you work. Notion is malleable enough to fit any process (even workflows custom to only your team), whether it’s a project-specific Kanban board or customizable templates used for recurring projects.
When a wiki functions as both a home to information and a place to get work done every day, it becomes the singular hub for just about anything your employees need. Everyone can go faster, with more information, and more connection to one another.
Move your entire workspace over to Notion without missing a beat. In just a few clicks, you won’t only have a more powerful wiki — you’ll have access to tools that enable connected, streamlined workflows.
----
In order to move your workspace over to Notion, you’ll first need to get it out of Confluence. Here’s how:
In your Confluence workspace, go toSpace Settingson the sidebar.
SelectContent Tools, then hitExporton the toolbar below.
ChooseHTMLfrom the format options. You’ll then be presented with export HTML options. ClickCustom Export.
Select which pages you want to export from Confluence and import to Notion. Keep in mind that pages with large attachments can increase export size and complexity!
Allow your export to finish processing. This could take some time. Grab a snack.
After the export is complete, clickDownload hereto save the export to your computer. You’ll get a zip file that contains the HTML version of the pages you selected.
----
If you don’t see these options, you might need to request permission to export from your workspace admin.
It takes about three clicks to get your entire Confluence workspace into Notion. They are:
Hit theImportbutton in your sidebar (on the bottom left).
SelectConfluencefrom the button menu.
Find the zip file containing your exported Confluence workspace and select it to be uploaded. Don’t worry about unzipping the file! Just upload the entire archive. Give it a few minutes for the upload to complete.
That’s it! Welcome to your new Notion wiki.
Now that your wiki is in Notion, here are some of the features you can use to make it shine.
----
Instead of worrying about parent and child pages, or previews and publishing, you can instantly create new pages in Notion that add to your company’s collective knowledge.
There are two ways to make a page:
From the sidebar— hover overWORKSPACEand hit the+sign to create a new top-level page in your workspace everyone has access to (same goes for adding a page to yourPRIVATEsection, where only you have access). Each team can have one of these top-level pages, like one for sales and one for marketing.
----
When you’re already inside a page— hit/to bring up a whole menu of options for things you can do in a Notion page (we call this the “slash command”). Type/pageand selectPageto make a new sub-page in a flash, and know it’s in the right place with automatic page hierarchies.
Pages in Notion are totally customizable. This flexibility allows teams to create pages that match their specific needs — whether that’s engineers adding code blocks, designers adding Figma files, or product teams including audio from a customer research interview.
Here are a few tools you can use to customize the Notion pages that’ll be in your wiki:
----
Embed just about anything— type/and the name of what you want to embed into a Notion page, like/codeor/video. This adds important texture, allowing teams to build unique Notion pages based on the work at hand.
Drag-and-drop for ultimate flexibility— the ability to move pages around your wiki helps keep everything organized. Grab the⋮⋮icon to drag-and-drop anything in your wiki, like including photos next to text or re-arranging pages under a specific header. You can even create columns. Drag a page or header all the way to the right and blue lines will help guide you.
----
Page covers and icons imbue every page with your brand— add a bit of flair and visual recognition to your pages with custom icons and page covers. These let you create a branded experience everywhere, instead of all pages that are one note.
Half of a wiki's utility comes from being able to easily find what you need.
Notion gives you two ways to surface that info, either from the sidebar or searching your entire workspace.
See all pages from your sidebar— in any top-level page in the sidebar, hit the>arrow to see all the sub-pages inside that page. You can go as deep as you’d like by hitting the arrow next to any sub-page to see all its sub-pages.
----
Search everything in your workspace— quickly access anything you need by typingcmd/ctrl+p. This brings up Notion’s search function. For example, you can type “dental benefits” to find the page that contains that information. You can even filter based on things like pages only edited within the last week or pages you created.
Your wiki holds the information your team needs to work. But when it comes time to execute? They’re probably leaving the wiki and opening another app.
Notion unites these two work streams, putting information alongside execution.
This allows any individual or team to build custom workflows for the task at hand. Here are a few suggestions from our team:
----
Include your company roadmap or projects right in your wiki— if your team is running projects on Notion, you can link your roadmap right at the top of your wiki. Why’s this useful? It keeps everyone on the same page and makes all work transparent. You can even create a custom view that’s just this week’s launches. And all the information about those launches is centrally accessible to teams or company-wide.
----
Use databases for any workflow you need— Notion has many different types of databases that are modifiable to fit your team’s needs, like tables, lists, galleries, Gantt charts, etc. Your roadmap might be a table. Meeting notes could be a list. Sprints can use a Gantt chart (we call it a Timeline since it's a bit more powerful). Learn all about themhere.
See how all your information is connected— backlinks in Notion show where else a page is referenced. This creates a rich graph of all your information, showing you where pages are linked, and maybe more importantly, where they need to be linked. Read up on backlinkshere.

Synced Databases bridge the gap between different tools
Synced Databases give you the power to bring information from different sources into Notion. You can create a single source of truth to unite your team by syncing Jira boards, Jira projects, GitHub PRs and GitHub issues as Notion databases.
When you oversee projects involving different teams, it’s challenging to make sure everyone’s on the same page, working with the latest version of events. Teams often rely on several tools to get work done, so you need a robust system to bring everything together and bridge the gap between the specialized tools your teams use, and the system to track and manage the work, where collaboration happens.
----
Sometimes, when teams are using different tools, important information about their work can stay in those tools, hidden from other teams and project managers. By created Synced Databases with GitHub and Jira, you can bring information from those tools into Notion, which provides clarity for everyone involved and means you’ll spend less time hopping between tools, asking for updates or searching for the latest versions of files.
You can easily create Notion databases that sync with your Jira boards, Jira projects, GitHub PRs and GitHub issues, bringing information from those tools into a database you can use to manage, track and oversee projects.
----
Synced Databases make life easier for all your team members, especially those who don’t use GitHub or Jira, but still need to see what’s going on. Instead of asking for logins and trying to navigate an unfamiliar tool, they’ll have access to everything they need right in the Notion database.
No more pinging engineers on Slack for updates on an urgent bug fix — you can just go straight into the database and see whether it’s done, saving everyone time and stress.
You’ll never have to manually update database entries with screenshots or links either, as the information will automatically pull through to the database for everyone to see.
----
And, you can rest assured you’ll always be looking at the latest version of events, as the database will update whenever changes are made in the original tool. Synced Databases are read-only, so although you can bring information into Notion from GitHub and Jira, any changes to a ticket, task or PR need to be made in the original tool, providing a safeguard against unintentional edits and preserving your source of truth. Only team members authorized to edit GitHub or Jira are able to make changes in the tool. It’s a good idea to leave a note at the top of the page letting people know who to get in touch with if they want to make any changes.
----
Synced Databases help streamline project management and aid collaboration. People from different teams can work together on a single Notion page, where they’ll share content, communicate and collaborate without needing to switch tools. You can also add more context to the information you pull into Notion. With relations and rollups you can link your Jira sprint to a larger team goal that lives in your OKRs database in Notion. When you’re looking at those OKRs, you’ll see relevant info coming from Jira, making it easier to measure and report on your progress.
----
To set up a Synced Database, you must first authenticate Jira in Notion. To do this, go to Settings & Members in your side bar, and choose My connected apps. Click “Connect” underneath Jira, and you’ll be prompted to authenticate by logging in to your Jira account. After you’ve authenticated once, creating synced databases is as simple as pasting a link.
You can now sync Jira boards or entire Jira projects into Notion. Here’s how:
In Jira, go to the board or project you want to sync, and copy the link.
Paste it into Notion and select “Paste as database.”
An empty database with a preset list of properties will show up in your page. It will show up in a Notion “table” view, with all Jira properties automatically added.
----
The database will start populating automatically and will continue to sync if you navigate away from the page.
Notion brings all Jira Issue types (Epics, Stories, Tasks, Bugs, Sub-tasks, etc.) to the synced database, where they’ll appear as separate rows. Every Jira story will be linked to its relevant epic via a property called “Parent”, and sprints are also reflected in synced databases as separate properties.
You can create specific views using Notion’s database filters, for example, to show all tasks within a Sprint or the Stories, Tasks, and Bugs that make up an Epic.
----
A kanban board can be a handy way to organize your sprints. To create one, first, selectAdd viewat the top of your synced database and selectBoard. Then click on database options (…),Group by, and chooseStatus. Set theSorttoManualso you can move groups around and have To-Do, In Progress, and Done ordered properly.
As with any Notion database, you can create as many filtered views as you need, to organize your information in different ways.
Create a calendar view to see when each task was created.
Use a timeline to visualize how your epics relate to one another, and see how many projects your team is juggling at once.
Add a board view grouping tasks by assigned engineer, so you’ll know exactly what everyone’s got on their plate.
----
You can syncGitHub IssuesandPull Requestsinto Notion, and anyone who has access to the page will be able to see the content, even if they don’t have access in GitHub.
Just like with Jira, you first have to authenticate with GitHub. Go toSettings & Members>My connected appsin the top left corner of your screen, and this time, you’ll click theConnectbutton under GitHub, and authenticate the account.
Once the authentication is successful, you can copy and paste links to GitHub Issues or Pull Requests into Notion pages.
All you have to do is go to GitHub, copy the link for Pull Requests or Issues you'd like to sync, and paste it into Notion, selectingPaste as a databasewhen prompted.
----
An empty database with a preset list of properties will immediately show up, as a Notion table database with all GitHub properties in the database.
Within the next few minutes, the database will start populating automatically, and you’ll know it’s done once you seeSynced just nowin the database header.
You can create views and filters exactly as you can with Jira, and any other Notion database, for example, you can sort your database by Issue Number date to view the most recent Issues / Pull Requests first.
----
With the relation property, you can connect information from different databases in Notion. This can help give context and tie information together according to project or team. So you’ll be able to associate GitHub PRs with projects in your roadmap, for example.
To add a relation to your Synced Database:
Go toProperties, and add a new property.
Under advanced properties, selectRelationas the property type.
Now a prompt will ask you which database you’d like to relate. Choose and select the relevant database.
You can also mention items from your Synced Databases anywhere in Notion by using the@symbol just as you would mention any Notion page.
----
With Github and Jira Synced Databases, you can set up auto-relations, so any time an item in the Synced Database (a Github PR or a Jira Issue for example) includes a link to a Notion page in the auto-related Notion database in its description or title, the relation will automatically be populated. This makes it easier to keep track of Pull Requests and Tasks/Issues in Notion.
When you create a new relation in your Jira or Github Synced Database, toggle onAutomatically Relateand selectUpdate relation
----
Now you’ll be able to add links to your Notion documents in your GitHub PR titles or descriptions or Jira Issues. To find the link, select the document in the database and clickCopy linkor open the document in a new tab and copy the link in your browser.
Add the link in your description. Now, once the PR is synced into Notion, a relation between the task and the linked document will be automatically populated in the Synced Database.
When you sync GitHub Pull Requests and Issues to Notion, you can search and mention individual PRs or Issues in your workspace using the@symbol just as you would mention any Notion document.
----
Once you’ve created a relation property linking your Synced Database to another database in your workspace, you can bring specific information from one database into the other using a rollup property.
Add a new property, choosingRollupfrom advanced properties, and give it a name.
Click on a cell in the rollup column and you’ll be able to choose:
The relation property you want to roll up.
The property of the related database you want to roll up.
The calculation you want to apply to them.
Let’s say you relate your Synced Database from Jira to your OKRs in Notion  - with a rollup, you can now visualize aggregated information, like percentage of tasks complete, right in Notion.
----
Or, you can relate your Meeting Notes database and use a rollup property to attach meeting notes, or see how many meetings you’ve had about any item.
Synced Databases let you bring accurate information from Jira and GitHub into Notion. Once you’ve established that connection, there’s really no limit to how you use that data — you can reference and resurface it throughout your workspace, keeping everyone up to date with work happening outside of Notion.
Manage individual workloads— Add views for each team member to track high priority tickets, issues, and PRs all in one place. Personalized views help your team members reduce distraction and get laser-focussed on what they have to do.
----
Connect GitHub issues with tasks— Create a relation to your team’s task dashboard in Notion, so you don’t have to spend time copying GitHub issues to your tasks database manually.
Create a summary view of related GitHub PRs, tasks, and Jira tickets— By connecting your projects database in Notion to Github and Jira Synced Database, you can get a broader view of everything that makes up a project brief.
Mention issues and tickets anywhere in your Notion workspace— You can@mentionissues and tickets to quickly link to the relevant page of your Synced Database, just like you would with any other Notion page.

Break tasks into manageable steps with sub-tasks and dependencies
When managing a busy team, your task database can become chaotic. Some tasks are quick and easy to complete, while others have a much broader scope and require many steps. Having all these tasks side by side gets confusing, and it’s hard to move forward when you’re unsure of what comes next.
If you find yourself with more than 50 rows in your tasks database, sub-tasks and dependencies can help you get a clearer picture of exactly what needs to get done by breaking big tasks down into smaller actions.
----
It’s easier to scope out the steps to complete a task, share the workload amongst your team by assigning specific steps to different team members, and define what needs to happen for a task to be marked “complete”.
You’ll quickly spot any tasks that are blocking your progress and need to get done before anything else.
Sub-tasks and dependencies are built using Notion’s relations properties. In this guide, we’ll explain how to easily get set up and use sub-tasks and dependencies for task management.
What are relation properties?

Publishing content like a blog post might sound like a straightforward task, but as marketing teams will know, there are many steps involved, from initial research and outlining to drafting and reviewing. It probably requires input from two or more team members, and even after publishing your post, you’ll have a bunch more tasks to distribute and promote it.
Let’s say you add a task to your database called “Publish ‘10 Ways to Use AI in Marketing’ blog post”. You can make this a parent task in your database, then create sub-tasks to research the topic, outline the post, write the draft, submit it for editing, review and publish.
----
Some of those tasks might even have their own sub-tasks. For example, publishing the post might involve a final review and SEO check, formatting, adding images, writing a meta description, and uploading to your CMS.
Here’s how to create a sub-item property in your tasks database:
Click on the…menu in the top right of the database, and selectSub-items.
In theSub-itemswindow, you’ll create a self-relating property. You can rename the properties to “Sub-tasks” and “Parent tasks”.
SelectCreate.
Now, you’ll see two new properties in the database, one for “Parent tasks” and one for “Sub-tasks”.
Any task in your database can have sub-tasks, which can be further broken down into smaller sub-tasks.
----
To add sub-tasks to any item in the database, just hover over, click the drop-down that appears and add as many sub-tasks as you need. Sub-tasks can be viewed in both table and timeline views.
Use dependencies to mark a task as dependent on another.
For example, imagine you’re working on a new feature launch. The order you complete tasks is important, as you can’t start publishing guides and email content until you’ve finalized the UI.
You could use dependencies in a timeline view to flag tasks that need to be completed before you move on to the next. This functions in much the same way as sub-items and is just another way to visually connect your work.
To add dependencies in timeline view:
Go to the…menu and click onDependencies.
----
If no relation exists in the database, you’ll be prompted to create one. By default, it will be a self-relation calledDependencies.
You can then choose whether to show dependencies by parent or sub-task.
ClickCreate new relation.
When you hover over any database item in your timeline, an arrow will appear on the right side. You can click on the arrow and drag it to connect one task with another to create a dependency which will appear only in a timeline view.
When you’re managing a fast-moving team, prioritizing and tracking everyone’s work is a major challenge. With sub-tasks and dependencies, you can juggle your team’s daily work while simultaneously making progress towards larger objectives.
Sub-tasks and dependencies help you:
----
Break tasks into sub-tasks— Many tasks in your task database are too broad to complete in one step, and actually require multiple actions, from more than one team member.  Breaking these large tasks down into individual steps makes it easier to set out and accomplish what needs to get done.
Help team members collaborate to get tasks done— Once you’ve broken a task down into its individual sub-tasks, you can then delegate or assign those smaller tasks to different members of your team. This helps your team collaborate, with everyone doing their part to reach your objectives.
----
Identify blockers halting your progress— Sometimes progress is stalled because you can’t move ahead until a certain task is complete. Dependencies make it obvious when this is happening, so you can prioritize getting it done and move on.
When you open a page in a database, you can view sub-items and dependencies as a relation at the top of the page.
----
Alternatively, you can choose to show sub-items as a page section, so when you open up a task, it’s immediately clear what all the subtasks are. In the sub-item section, you can click on the options menu…and select which corresponding properties you want to display (status, assignee, due date, etc.) Having sub-tasks show up as a separate page section also makes it easy to add new tasks to the page.
Sub-tasks and dependencies are primarily designed with task andproject managementin mind.
However, you can use these properties for anything you need.
For example:
----
Divide your OKRs into mini-goals— Create a sub-item property inside your company’s OKR database, and rename it to “Sub-goals” or “Mini-goals”. Then, you can add smaller goals that will add up to your overarching monthly, quarterly or annual goals.
Create parent teams and child teams in an org chart— You can use a sub-item property to create an org chart database, where you can see how each larger department is divided into smaller teams.
Record monthly and weekly updates in your docs database— Monthly update documents can become your parent items, with each weekly update a sub-item for the relevant month.

Show your team how to organize, track and manage work in Notion
No matter what you need to do in your personal life, you plan and track it in Notion. You create systems that work for you and get things done in a workspace that reflects your personality.
You’ve seen first-hand how your choice of tool can greatly impact your productivity and motivation. So why not bring your work life, and your teammates, over to Notion? They don’t know yet, but it will help them collaborate seamlessly, easily access the information they need, and get more done.
----
In this guide, we’ll show you how you can take inspiration from your personal Notion dashboards to build a workspace where your team will collaborate and manage tasks with custom workflows, project hubs, and more.
You already know how powerful Notion blocks are. A single tap of the slash command/, brings up a vast menu of things to create, like text blocks, images, videos, links, databases, embeds, and more.
Now imagine using Notion with your team: those same blocks that power personal planning and productivity can create product requirement documents, project trackers, and so much more.
----
You could set annual and monthly goals, manage tasks and projects, draft documents, handle finances, take notes, collaborate across teams and keep all company information in one place.
The possibilities are endless, and there are plenty of benefits to using Notion with your teams:
Create a fully customizable workspace— Notion gives you a blank page and the building blocks to create exactly what your team needs. You won’t be boxed in by a pre-formatted tool. Instead, you can design a system that fits your natural workflow (and tweak it as things change).
----
Keep it all in one place —Everything from company benefits information, vacation forms, work documents, meeting notes, project and task tracking and information related to groups and hobbies can live in Notion, stored in the right place, so you never have to wonder where to find it.
Provision the correct level of access for everyone —Want to make sure everyone can see the company’s top-level OKRs, but only senior management can make changes? Notion’s permissions and sharing settings allow you to give everyone the right level of access to documents and even share content with people outside the company.
----
Build smart connections between different aspects of work —Using relation properties, you can build connections between databases like projects, tasks, goals, and meeting notes. Syncing your databases in this way means you can see things like how many tasks are left to complete on a project, which projects relate to which OKRs, and easily reference meetings related to a particular project.
----
Integrate with other tools and media within Notion —Some teams will always need specialist tools. You can use synced databases to embed information from tools like Jira and Github into Notion, so information doesn’t stay hidden in those tools and can be viewed by everyone who needs it. You can embed images, videos, web bookmarks, whiteboards, and much more into any Notion page, so there’s no need to be constantly bouncing back and forth between tools.
Once you’ve got the go-ahead to try out Notion, it’s time to start building your team workspace.
There’s no need to spend hours designing a complex system. You can build your workspace piece by piece and use our templates to help get things moving quickly.
----
Start with the main building blocks of a company workspace, and you can expand and customize over time.
In your personal Notion space, you might have a dashboard or wiki that helps you navigate to your most-used pages, meaning information you need every day - your daily to-do’s, a checklist for your dog-sitter, your weekly grocery list, etc - is always on hand.
You can create a version of this for your company workspace. Thecompany wikiwill become the homepage for everyone on your team, and the main page of your “General” company teamspace (the default teamspace that includes everyone.)
----
One this top-level page you can keep things like employee directory, SOPS and guides, benefits information, vacation policy, the company mission, vision and values. You might even include the annual OKRs here and a link to each team’s homepage.
Teamspaces give each team an area for their work. They help organize the workspace in different categories so everyone knows where to go to find information relevant to their daily work.
You can create as many teamspaces as you have departments in your company - one for engineering, marketing, sales etc.
Teamspace admins can adjust permissions and sharing settings for teamspaces (and the pages within them). You can learn all about how teamspaces work inthis guide.
----
You can collect and organize pages in databases, and add multiple layers of information using properties.
We recommend three key databases for your team to start with:
A meeting notes database to capture essential insights from meetings— Take notes from every meeting in themeeting notesdatabase. Draft an agenda, take notes, and tag the type of meeting and people who attended.
A docs database for all company documents— In yourdocuments databaseyou can store everything from project briefs, technical specs, one-pagers and more. Tag people who are involved and label the document type with a select property.
----
A project & task management system— If you use a database for your personal to-do list, you can create something similar for your team. Start with the Projects & Tasks template which you’ll find if you go to “Templates” in your sidebar. This template gives you two connected databases where you can tag people responsible for each task or project, mark task and project status, and see how many tasks have to be done for each project to reach completion.
When you’re comfortable with these databases, there are plenty more things you can do using databases in your team workspace. Here’s just a few ideas:
----
Track candidates for your open roles— If you’ve ever used Notion to manage job applications, you can create a similarapplicant trackerto track candidates who apply to open roles in your company.
Record and tag company expenses— Just like your personal budget tracker, you can use a Notion database to record and tag company expenses.
Outline company OKRs for each quarter— Record your company goals in a Notion database so everyone can see them, similar to how you outline your personal goals. You can relate this database to projects to ensure that day to day work stay aligned with larger company objectives.
----
In every database, you can get work done faster with templates. Draft meeting agendas, project briefs or sprint plans in a flash by creating templates in the database. Learn more about database templateshere.
Within the company workspace, you can create your own personalized dashboard in yourPrivatespace in the sidebar and customize it according to how you work best.
To create a linked versions of another database, hit/, selectLinked view of databaseand choose the database you want to link, for example the task database.
Then, filter the database to only show work or notes that you’re tagged in.
----
If you want to change the database layout, go to options...,Layout. From here, select the layout that works best for you, be it a kanban board, calendar, timeline or table. You can add any additional filters that might be helpful, like a filter to show you all tasks due this week, tasks that areIn Progress, or those marked as high priority.
Now you have a customized task tracker that helps you stay super focussed and on track with your work. And, unlike an individual to-do list that stays hidden from the rest of the team, the work you do will be visible to all.
Notion is built for collaboration. Here are some ways you can foster easy collaboration with teammates and across teams:
----
Create shared documents with one or two other people— If you need to share a document with just one or two others, you can create a new page inShared. This could be for your 1:1s with your line manager, or for a draft of a presentation you are working on with a teammate.
Use comments to collaborate on a document— Everyone who has permission to comment can leave comments throughout a page. This means team members can get fast feedback on their work, and you can ask for another team to leave suggestions on a document.
----
Create an upvote database to brainstorm ideas for the next meeting— To get the opinions and priorities of your teammates, create an upvote database where people can enter suggestions, and everyone can vote for items they want to discuss.
Share pages with another team— Give the engineering team access to comment or edit a document that the design team are working on. This can help collaboration across teams and ensure that cross-functional projects progress smoothly.

Teamspaces give every team a home for important work
Whether your organization consists of 50 people, or 5000, chances are it’s made up of various teams, all working on their own tasks, projects, and goals that coalesce into your company’s overarching objectives.
Notion is where you keep all of your knowledge — be it meeting notes, project roadmaps, launch calendars, content boards, ad-hoc docs, or general information such as your mission statement and benefits policy.
With all that knowledge living side by side in the company workspace, you need a clear path to the content you use day in, day out. Managers have to make sure everyone on their team is on track, and can find what they need to get work done.
----
Teamspaces streamline access to information, creating a dedicated area for every team which can be customized to suit their way of working. Managers can empower their team members to find information and work independently, and can arrange the sidebar however makes sense for them. Instead of employees being overwhelmed with stuff they don’t need, they have a slice of the workspace to call home, which contains everything they need to get down to work.
Every team, and team member, has their own way of working. Teamspaces allow leaders to set up their department for success by designing a decluttered workspace-within-a-workspace, with custom permissions to ensure proper access to content.
----
However, that doesn’t mean employees must be boxed in. People can join as many teamspaces as are relevant to their work (one for engineering, and one for the San Francisco office, for example) You can also view content in teamspaces you haven’t joined yet depending on the permissions settings of each teamspace.
Each workspace will have at least one teamspace that includes everyone by default. This default teamspace will be named "General," and we recommend keeping all company-wide information, like your top-level goals, benefits policies, and mission statement.
Scroll down the sidebar to “All teamspaces”
All teamspaces you’re a member of show up under “Joined teamspaces”
----
Below that, you’ll see all the teamspaces you can join. Hover over the one you want, and just click “Join.”
If the teamspace has an 🔓 symbol next to it, that means it’s a Closed teamspace, and someone will need to invite you to join.
Your Notion workspace doesn’t have to be one size fits all. Most likely, the way your design team works will be very different to, say, engineering. With teamspaces, each department can choose how they view information and set up unique workflows.
Create a teamspace for every department in your company— At Notion, we have teamspaces for marketing, sales, finance, engineering, and so on.
----
Unite cross-functional, topic-based groups— For example, you could create a teamspace for everyone in your London office. Individuals may belong to a few teamspaces based on their department and role in the company.
Bring people together to collaborate on projects— You can create a teamspace to organize the documentation and tasks for any kind of project, even if it’s short-term. When the work is done, you can archive the teamspace (all its contents can be recovered later, if you ever need them.)
Click the+button to the right of the teamspaces label in your sidebar, or go toAll teamspaces, and click+ New teamspace
Give your teamspace a name and a description, and you can choose an icon.
----
Choose the Permissions settings for your teamspace, and select “Create teamspace”
Now the teamspace appears in your sidebar, and you’ll be prompted to add people to your new team. Simply type their email or name into the text box, and choose whether to add them as members or teamspace owners.
To add everyone in your workspace automatically to your team, toggle on “Make default teamspace.” Most likely, you’ll only need one default teamspace, and we’d recommend no more than three, even for large workspaces.
----
The Notion sidebar is a tool for navigating around the workspace quickly, and you can customize the sidebar to make it easy for everyone to find what they need. Just click “+” next to your teamspace to add a top-level page that will appear in the sidebar, and you can then add the page content (and add as many sub-pages as required.)
Here are some suggestions for some top-level pages to keep in the sidebar:
Your team’s homepage or wiki— Depending on how you set up your sidebar (and the size of your team) this could look like a page for each sub team, or just one page for the whole team. Regardless, it’s important to have a homepage where everyone can come to find information.
----
If you’re using teamspaces to organize larger departments, we recommend creating one top level page for each sub team. For example, an engineering org might have a “platform engineering” home page, a “marketing engineering” home page, and so on.
Key working documents— Things your team members need to review everyday, like your shared roadmap or project launch calendar, work well as top-level pages.
Read-only docs that everyone needs to see— Mission statements, company history, or team offsite information can be kept in the sidebar.
Team members can also “Favorite” their most-used pages by clicking the star icon at the top right of the page, meaning they can access what they need in just a couple of clicks.
----
As a Team leader, you also get control over who has access to what. Within your teamspace, you can change permissions settings and adjust what level of access people or groups have to pages.
So, for example:
Managers should have full access to the whole teamspace. You can provision this in the teams settings menu under “permissions.”'
Engineers working on projects in the Roadmap could have Can Edit access, meaning they can make changes in the page but aren’t able to share the page externally.
People who aren’t members of the teamspace might have Can View access.
----
If you want to make your OKRs read-only, or prevent certain pages from being shared, you can adjust the permission settings of those pages directly from the “Share” menu at the top right.
There are three kinds of teamspaces - Open, Private and Closed. With these three options, teamspace owners are able to control who has access to team information, and how that access is shared.
Open teamspaces— Anyone can join an Open teamspace and view the content inside the teamspace. In Open teamspaces, everyone automatically has access to all pages, but you can change these permissions at the page level. To promote transparency, we recommend that most teamspaces should be set to Open by default.
----
Closed teamspaces— Everyone can see that the teamspace exists, but can’t join unless they’re invited by an owner or member. Closed teamspaces are useful when you need some control over who can join, for example you could create a closed teamspace for all managers in your company.
----
Private teamspaces (Enterprise Plan only)— Only members or owners can add other people to a private teamspace, and it won’t be visible to people who are not added. Use private teamspaces when a group is working on something sensitive that needs a degree of privacy or anonymity - HR might use a private teamspace for collecting and collaborating on employee feedback, or accounting may need to use a private teamspace when compensation and performance reviews are being discussed.
You can easily edit your teamspace settings by clicking the options•••next to your team and choosing “Teamspace settings & members.” The window that pops up has four different tabs:
----
General— Edit the name, description and teamspace icon. You can also archive the teamspace if you no longer need it.
Members— Add new members and groups to the teamspace. Click the drop down next to people’s names to make edit their role (whether they are teamspace owners or members) or remove them from the teamspace. If you are on an Enterprise Plan, you can also assign granular permissions to specific people or groups.
----
Permissions— Choose whether you want your teamspace to be open, closed or private. Adjust the access levels for teamspace owners, members and everyone else with the dropdown menu where you can between Full access, Can edit, Can comment and Can view. In the Permissions tab you can also choose whether teamspace members can invite others, and edit the sidebar (or if you only want owners to have those abilities.)
----
Security (Enterprise Plan only)—  Choose whether to allow members to share pages to the web, and you can toggle on or off inviting guests to pages, and exporting pages. You’ll only be able to make these settings more permissive than the workspace-level settings if you’re a teamspace owneranda workspace owner (e.g. guests are not allowed across the workspace, but you want them to be allowed for one teamspace).
Permissions in teamspaces
Click to expand
There are different ways to share information in a Notion workspace. So what’s the difference between Teams, Groups, and Shared pages?
----
Use teamspaces to organize content for a consistent working group—  Keep all Engineering pages stored in a single teamspace, with top-level pages customized exclusively for that team. For team members, the information they need for their day-to-day work is easily discoverable.
Groups allow team owners to easily set default permissions in Teamspace settings— If you’re on an Enterprise Plan, team owners can give individuals and groups different levels of access to certain pages in a teamspace, making some “read-only” or giving folks permission only to comment, or to edit the page but not share.
----
Share pages when you’re drafting work, or collaborating 1:1— For ad-hoc collaborations, rough drafts or 1:1 meeting notes, you can share a private page with an individual person.

The best way to set up your team’s sidebar for clear organization
Your sidebar is the map that helps you navigate all the pages in your workspace and access tools like search, settings, updates, and templates.
When it’s well-organized, you can get around quickly and create new pages in an instant, saving your team time they used to spend digging through messy docs folders. It provides a bird’s eye view of your workspace, and you can easily reshuffle the layout as needed.
In this article, you’ll learn all the features of the Notion sidebar, and we’ll show you how to set it up for easy, fast access to everything you need.
You can also watch this video demonstration to see the sidebar in action:
----
To open the sidebar, hover over the top left of the screen. Click the arrows to lock the sidebar open, or toggle to show or hide using the shortcutcommand + \for Mac, orcontrol + \for Windows.
You can switch between all the workspaces you belong to using the drop-down menu in the top left corner of your sidebar. If you have multiple email accounts associated with Notion (like one for work and one for personal use), then you’ll see your workspaces organized by email.
Now let’s take a tour of what’s in your sidebar.
----
Quick Find— use this (or hitcmd/ctrl + p) to search for anything in your workspace (including words inside pages). You can filter to find pages created by you, or edited in the last week. For example, it’s easy for your employees to search “dental benefits” and find the page with all the information they need to make their next appointment.
Inbox— here you'll find your notifications. You’ll see reminders, or if you are tagged anywhere. Page updates are also visible here (in theFollowingtab). You can save time by replying to comments or messages directly in this menu.
"Updates" is now "Inbox"
----
We're always working to improve your Notion experience. Recently, the "Updates" menu in the sidebar changed to "Inbox." This new experience has a better look and feel, and improved workflows for triaging notifications. Happy collaborating!
Settings & Members— this is where you manage your account settings. You can change workspace settings, or configure your entire Notion account by changing your membership, notification settings, and more.
Favorites— you can go to the top right of any Notion page and clickFavorite. This will add the page to your favorites menu at the top of the sidebar. Keep frequently-visited pages here to access them in seconds.
----
Workspace— this is home to all top-level pages your team has. All workspace members can access these pages.
Shared— in this section, you'll see any pages that are shared only between you and at least one person in your workspace. You could use this space to collaborate with a teammate on the Q4 marketing plan before sharing it with the rest of the company.
Private— only you can access pages you create here. When you’re ready to share with the team, just drag-and-drop them wherever they belong in the workspace.
Templates— click to open up Notion’s template gallery. We’ll explain more about how to make the most of these later on, but know that you can use these as a springboard for pages you and your team might use.
----
Import— this button lets you transfer data from Evernote, Asana,Confluence, and other software right into Notion in a flash.
Trash— all deleted pages live here. You can either restore or delete them permanently.
From the sidebar, you can quickly access any page in your workspace.
In the workspace section, you’ll first see all top-level pages (which can hold an infinite number of sub-pages).It’s best to keep your sidebar organized at the highest level so it’s not overloaded.
Give each team its own top-level page that acts as their wiki, holding all their team-specific information. You can also have a top-level page that’s for everyone at the company, containing pages like “Mission and Values,” “Benefits,” or “Vacation Policy.”
----
You don’t even have to click into these top-level pages to access their sub-pages. Use the toggle to see all the sub-pages and jump right in from the sidebar.
You can create new pages in the sidebar by clicking the+next to workspace, shared, or private (depending on what you need). If you’ve created aMeeting Notes database for the product team, you’ll want to see this as a sub-page in the product team’s homepage. So, just drag-and-drop your new page into the Product top-level page. It now lives there.
Here are some tips from the Notion team to help you get the most out of your sidebar.
Try hiding the sidebar for a clean, minimal page where you can focus on your work and eliminate distractions.
----
Top-level pages in your workspace section should represent the overarching departments of your company. But at Notion, we also have company-wide Meeting Notes and Docs databases shared by everyone. We then use a series of tags to organize these by department or type of meeting/document. Learn more aboutteam notes & docs.
It's a good rule of thumb to stick to a small number of top-level pages and file all your other pages and work inside of them. The toggles will always give you clear pathways to what you need.
----
Use the private section to work solo before a page is ready for collaboration. With Notion’ssharing and permissions settingson the top right of any page, you can add teammates to get their feedback or input. Once shared, the page then moves into the shared section of your sidebar. When it’s ready for company-wide use, simply drag it into the workspace section.
Rotate your favorites depending on what you’re working on at any given time. You might be executing a product launch for the month and need to reference that page frequently. But after that? Drag it into your archive and make space for the next project page.
----
Create an archive page where you can easily drag-and-drop old projects, finished work, and anything you no longer need but may want to reference later.
We’ve designed a library of templates for teams and individuals that you can access at the click of a button, which makes building out your company’s Notion workspace a breeze.
When you openTemplatesin the sidebar, you can start browsing the Notion template gallery all organized based on your needs.We’ve got a range of templates to choose from — you’ll find everything from user research databases and content calendars, to job boards and company home pages, to engineering roadmaps and a sales CRM.
You’ll find plenty of inspiration in our fulltemplate gallery.
----
To add a template to your workspace, select the template you want and click the blueUse this templatebutton. That’s it! The page has been added to your private workspace section. You can now customize it here, or drag it straight to where it belongs in your workspace.

The only Notion setup you need for keeping New Year’s resolutions
Accomplishing goals is all about daily progress — and when your goals are in one place, they’re top of mind and actionable.
Normally, they’d be buried in different tools. An app for tracking fitness. Another for your reading list. One for finances. You shouldn't have to check three different apps just to see what you need to do in a day. After all, the key to hitting goals is to keep them front and center.
With Notion, you can unite all the different types of goals you have, break them into manageable tasks and timelines, and see how you’re tracking toward those big picture changes.
Tips for conducting a yearly retrospective.
----
How to create dashboards that connect everything you need to accomplish your goals.
Techniques for staying on top of your resolutions throughout the year.
Soon, you could have a planner that looks like this:
Conducting a yearly retrospective shapes your planning because it surfaces what's most important to you.
Steve Schlafman is a coach and the founder of boutique leadership development company High Output. When it comes to his yearly retro, he says, "It's really hard to know what you want and what you value without doing that inventory."
Steve finds it helpful to look at the past year through five different lenses:
Success and growth
Falling short
People and relationships
Health and wellness
Lessons and themes
----
Each of these sections has distinct questions meant to put things into perspective in different areas of your life. He asks questions like “What do I wish I accomplished?”, “What am I most proud of personally and professionally?”, and “What am I most thankful for?” When turning these into high-level goals for the next year, Steve suggests the "stop doing, start doing, and keep doing" format.
Marie Poulin, a digital strategist and designer who helps businesses create systems for their work, puts all responses in a Notion database. In a Notion page dedicated to planning, she uses aGallerywhere each page is its own year. That way, as she's planning the year, the retrospective on the past year is nestled in a toggle, top of mind.
----
This is also helpful for some of the fine points she wants to put on the year to come, like certain words or vision statements that keep her focused on what's most important.
"These anchor how you want to feel. It's not something you do once and it gets buried," she says. "It's something that gets baked into your weekly reviews or quarterly reviews. It's always there."
These should be the biggest things you want to accomplish this year, serving as your North Star. If it's helpful, look at your yearly retrospective to focus these goals in distinct areas of your life.
“Some people say ‘I should do this’ or ‘I need to do this.’ Then there’s people who say ‘I’m willing to do this,’” says Steve. “Focus on what you’re willing to do.”
----
What matters to you? Set goals with the intention to do them.
Here's how you might do that in Notion:
Create aTablefor all your goals. Eventually, we'll connect this database to your projects and actions needed to accomplish these goals.
Use aSelectproperty to categorize these goals based on the areas you identified in your yearly retrospective. These can be things like "Health and Fitness," "Personal Development," or "Career Growth."
Use anotherSelectproperty to assign the goal a status. Think "In Progress," "Complete," or "De-prioritized."
For now, this database can remain simple. We'll start usingRelationproperties so you can see all the tasks associated with each of these goals.
Too many resolutions are set and then forgotten.
----
When your goals live alongside the work you do every day, they’re never more than a click away. This ensures they’re never forgotten, and get integrated into your daily life.
Marie uses a series of connected databases to uncover what projects roll up into her high-level annual goals, and then what tactical actions are needed to complete those projects (and thus, her goals).
"Notion is the only place I have found that allows me to see both high-level and really granular information in the same place without having to jump around," says Marie. "It keeps me following through on the bigger picture stuff that really matters."
----
We'll walk you through how to do this yourself. Let’s start by creating distinct Notion databases and connecting them to your goals:
Create a newTablefor your projects. Think about those big goals, and what smaller-level projects or milestones are needed to achieve them. Each page in the table should be a project. For example, if your goal is to pay off your credit card debt, a project might be to do a balance transfer.
Create a separateTablefor next actions. These should be the actionable things you need to do for each project. One next action for your balance transfer might be researching credit cards without a balance transfer fee. List out all the actions related to each project.
----
UsingRelationproperties, connect all your databases. Goals, projects, and next actions should all be connected so you can see what you’re doing to accomplish your goals.
Now you can start assigning timelines to your goals, projects, and next actions. You'll do something similar to what you just did above.
Create two separateGalleries, one for quarters and months.
In the quarter gallery, make each yearly quarter its own page. "Q1," "Q2," etc.
Do the same thing for the month gallery, making each month a page.
Use aRelationproperty to connect your goals database to your quarters database, assigning each goal to one of the year's four quarters.
----
In the months database, useRelationproperties to connect your goals, projects, and next actions databases. This way, you can see what you need to do each month, both at the granular level of actions and big picture level of goals.
You can get even more granular, assigning timelines for projects and dates for actions.
Having several, connected databases gives you the ability to see your goals and actions many different ways, whether that's by the month, by the quarter, or seeing all the tasks associated with a project. Instead of jumping between apps or your calendar to see everything you need to do, it's all in one place.
----
You can make custom views of any database, depending on the information you need to see. Whether it’s a view that’s projects for the quarter or tasks for the week, everything’s in one place.
To stay accountable, Marie uses linked databases with specific views everywhere in her workspace to tighten her focus, knowing she’s working toward her goals.
Marie keeps a weekly planner as a Notion gallery, where each page is its own week. Inside those pages is a linked view of her actions database, filtered to see only actions she needs to complete that week. This weekly planner is a template, so whenever she starts a new week, it’s spun up in one click.
----
In her top-level planning page, Marie keeps full-page databases for goals, projects, months, quarters and years. That way, she can click into any and see what’s happening and when.
She also conducts reviews every week and every quarter. Again, these are templates with a set of questions to help assess how she felt, how things went that week or that quarter. But they also have a view of her goals database, so she can track her progress toward these goals.
“By doing this on a regular basis, it makes monthly, quarterly and yearly planning a lot easier,” says Marie. “Notion allows me to see all that data and get a really good snapshot.”

The ultimate guide to Notion templates
Notion’s Template Gallery is the home for all Notion templates built by and for the community. Whether you’re an individual looking for a daily habit tracker or a grocery list, or an enterprise company looking for a team knowledge base or an editorial calendar, the Template Gallery is the best source of truth.
In this guide, we’ll dive into templates, how to find and use templates to improve your workflows, and how you can create your own.
----
A template is a prebuilt Notion page that you can add into your workspace. Instead of trying to rebuild a simple page or a complex workflow, simply add a Notion template into your workspace and get started. Templates can be anything from a team knowledge base to a personal workout tracker, and everything in between.
Notion’s Template Gallery is the premier place to find any templates you might need. It includes over 250 searchable categories and creator profiles, making it easier than ever to find a template for your specific use case.
To find a template, navigate tonotion.so/templates. On the Template Gallery home page, you’ll find a few primary sections:
----
Search bar —Search by keyword, team, category, creator, and more to find the perfect template for you. Simply type in your word or phrase to find templates, categories, and creators that match your search term.
Categories —Navigate through various categories and sub-categories to discover various use cases. As you click into categories, you’ll find more specific categories and use cases to help you narrow down your search.
Popular templates —See the most used templates from the past week in the Notion community across work, student, and personal use cases.
Top categories —See the most used categories and sub-categories from the past week.
----
Template collections —Find pre-built collections of templates on a specific topic or workflow. Use as many templates as you’d like to start building our your new workflow.
Featured creators —Meet our top template creators, from thought leaders to creative professionals to leading companies.
Click theTemplatesbutton in the Notion sidebar to get started. This will open a popup window of the Template Gallery in Notion. Once there, use the dropdown menu in the upper left corner to select your category and see popular subcategories in the sidebar.
Alternatively, you can use the search in the upper left to find specific templates that fit your needs.
----
Once you identify the template(s) you’d like to use, click theStart with this templatebutton. If you’re already signed into Notion, the template will automatically be added to your workspace in the Private section of your sidebar. If you’re logged out or don’t have a Notion account, you’ll be prompted to sign in or create an account first.
You can also play around with templates and see how they work before deciding to add them into your workspace. To do this, clickView templateto see the template in action and click through the template’s sections and features.
----
Once you’ve added a template into your workspace, you have endless options for what you can change, edit, or update to fit your needs. Templates are just a starting point to help you create your ideal workspace.
Here are a few common updates and changes that you can make once duplicating a template:
Pages— Update the page cover photo, add/change an icon, and change the page title.
Text— Add formatting, like bold, italics, text color, and background color. Change heading levels, add bullet or numbered lists, and move sections around.
Blocks— Add blocks like callouts, toggle lists, or tables. Remove blocks that you don’t need to reduce clutter or make space for extra blocks.
----
Databases— Change property names, types, and icons, or add/remove properties that don’t fit your needs. Add new database views, like boards, lists, calendars, timelines, or galleries.
Customizing your pages in Notion

Any publicly shared page in Notion that can be duplicated is considered a template. This enables the entire Notion community to share its favorite workflows with other Notion users with a simple click of a button.
If you have a specific template or workflow you’d like to share with the community, we highly encourage you to create and submit a template!
Before you set off building and sharing, there are some important considerations for creating a template:
----
Good templates are useful.Templates are tools; tools solve a clear problem or need for someone. There’s both a clear audience for your template and a clear problem to be solved, and your template solves that problem.
Good templates are differentiated.Notion is more flexible than typical word document. Differentiated templates combine one or more of Notion’s core product types (docs, projects, and wikis), or are very clearly visually different than a basic word document.
Good templates are scalable.If your template is intended for team use, it should be able to work with more than just one person. There are a few key points to check to ensure scalability:
----
If it’s intended for collaboration, what might this look like if you added 10 people? 50? 100?
If you added content from the last two months, what would it look like?
If you already have lots of stuff in your Notion, does it easily fit in?
Good templates have the basics.They’re inoffensive, use correct spelling, and are thoughtfully structured.
Add directions to make your template easier to use
At the top of or throughout your template, include a tutorial (like a Loom video) or written instructions for how to use, tweak, or customize the template.
To learn more about the Template Gallery Guidelines and Terms,click here.
----
You can make any Notion page a template by clickingSharein the top right, select the Publish tab, and click thePublishto web button. Make sure the Allow duplicate as template is toggled on. To share, use the public-facing URL or click theCopy web linkbutton in the Publish tab.
To submit a template to the gallery, go tonotion.so/templatesand click theSubmit a templatebutton in the upper right corner or visitnotion.so/submit-a-template. Fill out the form (including your public template link, template name, template descriptions, and template category) to share your template with the Notion community! While you can only submit one template at a time, there’s no limit on how many total templates you can submit.

The ultimate quickstart guide to Notion for Enterprise
Getting started with Notion for Enterprise gives you access to more customizability and control over admin, security, provisioning, and more. There are plenty of features to explore within your company workspace, so it’s important to understand the scope of what’s available.
In this guide, we’ll discuss some of the most vital features available for Enterprise and a few best practices for building a clean, productive, and secure Notion workspace that meets your organization’s needs.
Learn more about security & compliance
For more information on security & compliance best practices on Notion Enterprise, check out this guide.
----
There are four types of users on Notion Enterprise, all consisting of varying levels of permissions, so it’s important to organize users based on their intended usage:
Workspace ownershave full access to all workspace settings and have elevated privileges, such as the ability to add new members. Every workspace must have at least one owner.
AMembership adminis an administrative role built specifically for Enterprise user management that allows Workspace owners to delegate membership responsibilities. Ensuring members have access to the right workspace and relevant groups is often managed by IT teammates, Product Ops, or other functional Chiefs of Staff.
----
Membersare paid users and have full access to the workspace, including a personal section of the workspace. This is the default role when joining a workspace, and is a good role for most people at your company. All members are allowed to view, create, and share pages, and is a good way to maximize usage of Notion without granting additional administrative privileges.
Guestsare free users, but are limited to the specific pages that they’ve been granted access to and do not have a personal section of the workspace. These users are intended for external collaborators and are not supported by SSO & SCIM.
----
Notion has plenty of flexibility when it comes to user type delegation. As our customers grow on Notion, it’s a best practice to limit the number of workspace owners that have full access to all workspace settings (such as Audit Log, Content Search, and Identity & Provisioning) to a smaller administrative team.
Teamspaces provide streamlined access to information by creating a dedicated area of your company’s workspace that can be customized to meet the requirements for a specific team or project.
----
Most organizations set up a company teamspace for all users, plus individual teamspaces for every department (like Product, Engineering, Marketing, Customer Success, etc.). Individual users can be added to specific teamspaces, limiting the information that is openly accessible.
Creating Teamspaces
To create a teamspace in Notion, you can click the+icon next to Teamspaces in the sidebar, or you can use theNew teamspacebutton located in Settings & members > Teamspaces.
Adding structure to teamspaces
To enforce a more structured workspace, you can limit teamspace creation to workspace owners only using the toggle underSettings & members > Teamspaces.
To learn more about how workspace owners can set up teamspaces,read our guide here.
----
Adding and Managing Teamspace Members
By default, workspace members won’t see new teamspaces, though it’s easy to add members to specific teamspaces. In Teamspace settings > Members, you can search existing workspace members or groups or add members manually via email.
Once a member is added to a teamspace, their role can be toggled between member or teamspace owner for additional privileges.
Teamspace-Specific Settings
Each teamspace has its own settings (separate from workspace settings) so you can control more granular options for each area that you create.
For organizations focused on ensuring that information stays secure within their workspaces, check the following settings to make sure they align with your needs:
----
Disable public page sharing—dictates whether a page can be published to the web.
Disable guests— limits sharing of current teamspace to workspace members only.
Disable export—turns off the ability for users to export pages from this teamspace.
As a workspace owner, you can easily build out your organization’s Notion instance in a way that’s custom to your company.Settings & membersis where you can control the finer details, like access and membership, permissions, plan and billing information, security, and more.
Before you start working in Notion, it’s important to understand what settings exist for your workspace and what they do. Let’s cover a few basics, then we’ll dive into specific sections in more detail later in this guide.
----
This section is the starting point for many companies, as it’s where you set up a few of the most important basic settings that appear internally and externally.
Name—set the name of your company’s workspace. This is often just your company name (we set ours to readNotion), but can be customized to what fits best.
Icon— upload an image (usually your company logo) for your workspace.
Workspace Domain— create a personalized domain for your workspace. This domain is used for two reasons:
Pages shared to the web will be shared using this domain ([domain].notion.site)
Anyone with an allowed email domain can join the workspace using this domain (www.notion.so/[domain])
----
Allowed Email Domains— add your workspace’s allowed email domains. Any users with email addresses that belong to the domain(s) listed here can automatically join your workspace. For most organizations, this is their company email domain (i.e.,acmeinc.com). To get started, there needs to be at least one confirmed member with the domain before it can be added.
For more information, continue on to theAllowed Email Domainssection below.
Widely-used public domains such asgmail.comandoutlook.comcan’t be set as allowed email domains.
General teamspace settings allow you to control settings that apply globally to your workspace.
Default teamspaces— choose the teamspaces that all new and current workspace members automatically join.
----
Limit teamspace creation— toggle this setting on to only allow workspace owners the ability to create teamspaces.
Manage all teamspaces— this section is where you can manage all teamspaces and their respective settings. See members, security settings, and access levels by teamspace.
Here is where Workspace owners and Membership admins can view and manage members, groups, and guests in the workspace.
Manage members and access— make sure all members in your workspace have the right level of access and that they are in the correct teamspaces.
Set up permissions groups— these allow you to easily manage page permissions and teamspace access in bulk, rather than on an individual member basis.
Managing permissions groups with an IdP
----
If you plan to leverage SCIM, we recommend creating and managing groups from your IdP to ensure they sync properly with Notion. Some SCIM applications may not support importing groups, meaning they won’t pull any groups created in Notion.
Monitor guest access—review any guests that currently have access to your company’s workspace, and revoke access if necessary.
Adding guests in Notion
Guests can only be added at the page level via the Share menu.
View and manage users who have recently left the workspace—view the log of members that left the workspace in the last 30 days. To prevent data loss, you can transfer ownership of those users’ private pages to another member (i.e., to their manager).
----
Manage workspace and guest requests—members can request new people to be added as members or guests into your workspace. Workspace owners and membership admins can approve or decline these requests here. You can find more information about guest invite requests here.
Adding members without an IdP
If you aren’t using an Identity Provider (IdP), this is where you can also manually add/remove members.
Workspace plan and billing information can be found here to help manage all aspects of billing in Notion.
For customers on automated billing, you can update your plan and billing intervals (monthly vs annually) here
----
For customers on quarterly true-ups via the Sales team, please work with your dedicated Account Management team for any questions about your Enterprise license
Billing with Allowed Email Domains enabled
The cost for any members who have joined the workspace via Allowed Email Domains will be added to your Enterprise License.
Learn more about your workspace security settings in our guide here.
Identity & provisioning
Verify your domain, manage workspaces that belong to your domain, and configure SAML SSO & SCIM in theIdentity & provisioningtab. For more information, continue to theManaging Users in Notionsection below.
Content Search
----
Filter and search the workspace content and manage permissions on pages as needed. For more information, continue to theContent Searchsection below.
Connections
With Notion’s API, you can connect other software tools to your workspace for even more functionality within your workspace. There are additional settings for managing these connections on the Enterprise plan so workspace owners can regulate who in the workspace can install them:
No restrictions—all workspace members can install connections in the workspace
Only from approved list—workspace members can only install connections that are pre-approved by a workspace owner
To learn more about managing connections in your workspace, please refer to our Help Center article here.
Audit Log
----
Provides an overview of a large range of events that have occurred in the workspace. For more information, continue to theAudit Logsection below.
There are multiple ways to manage users in Notion depending on your organization’s preferences and needs.
Notion’s SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.
To get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you will need to complete the following steps:
----
Verify domain(s)—to use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domain’s DNS to verify your ownership of it.
Enable SAML SSO—this will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration.For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer to ourIDP-specific guides.
Change default login method—once SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set toAny method, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this toOnly SAML SSO, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace.
----
Link additional workspaces (optional)—if you have more than one workspace you’d like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out toteam@makenotion.com.
Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there’s an IdP/SAML SSO failure.
Guests are not supported through SAML SSOor SCIM.
While most of our Enterprise customers leverage an Identity Provider (IdP) to provision new users, there are many ways to add a new user account to your workspace:
Manually by Email
----
Workspace owners and Membership admins can add a new member to the workspace by email underSettings & members>Members.
Allowed Email Domains
Any users that login to Notion with your domain(s) listed in the Allowed Email Domains setting will be able to join the workspace as a member, and the additional cost will be added to your Enterprise License.
Allowed Email Domains and IdP
If you’re planning to manage the members that get added to your workspace strictly via your IdP, we recommend removing any domains listed in the Allowed Email Domains setting inSettings & members > Settings.
Just-in-time (JIT) Provisioning
----
Notion supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. WhenAutomatic account creationis enabled inSettings & members > Identity & provisioning, any user who logs into Notion for the first time via your SAML SSO connection will have a new member account generated using the name and e-mail on the SAML response.
Using JIT and SCIM
We don't recommend enabling Just-in-Time provisioning if you are using SCIM, as there could be a mismatch between membership in your IDP and in Notion.
Invite Link
----
UnderSettings & members>Members, you’ll find an option to enable an invite link. Once enabled, you may share this link and anyone that visits it will be able to join your workspace automatically without the need for you to enter their email manually.
SCIM API
Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de-provision members and groups. Workspace owners can find the required API key by going toSettings & members>Identity & provisioning>SCIM Configurationand clicking to view the token.
Please seeour SCIM documentationfor the latest information on how you can interact with Notion’s SCIM API. Notion supports official SCIM applications with Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.
Getting started with SCIM
----
Configure and enable SCIM provisioningpriorto assigning members to the application to ensure provisioned user identifiers are captured correctly.
Details about SCIM applications
The Google SCIM application does not support Group provisioning and de-provisioning. For other IdPs without an official application, you can reference ourSCIM API documentationto set up a custom SCIM integration.
When setting up SCIM for multiple workspaces, while you can have one IdP tenant for SSO setup, you will need a separate application for each workspace as the API keys for SCIM operate only at the workspace level.
When it’s necessary to de-provision a member, it’s important to remove them from a workspace and transfer their content to an existing member.
----
Manually in Members tab
Workspace owners and Membership admins can remove a user from the workspace underSettings & members > Members. Sessions for these users are immediately terminated and they can’t rejoin a workspace themselves and must be added back manually or via SCIM.
Automatically via SCIM
SAML SSO doesn’t include automatic de-provisioning of users by itself. For this use case, you must be using our SCIM API with your Identity Provider to send requests for de-provisioning.
Please seeour SCIM documentationfor the latest information on how you can interact with Notion’s SCIM API.
Transferring user content
----
When a member leaves a workspace, they will appear underSettings & members > Membersin theRecently Lefttab. From here, you can transfer their private pages to another user.
These pages will be packaged under one document now located under the newly selected member’sPrivatesection in the left sidebar.
Enterprise workspace owners have additional settings that can help add more granularity and control over how their managed users work in Notion. Find these settings underSettings & members > Identity & provisioning > User Management.
Understanding "managed users" in Notion
A "managed user" includes any account created with the organization's verified email domain. Continue to the Managing your domain in Notion section below for more detail.
----
Settings for managing users accounts
Admins have access to multiple important settings that help manage and control user accounts in Notion.
Allow users to change account information —set if users can change their preferred name, email address, and profile photo.
External workspace access —control if managed users are able to join workspaces that are not owned by your organization.
Prevent managed users support access —control which users can allow Notion support to remote login for troubleshooting. For more information on what Notion support can view, look at our terms of service.
Session Duration —set how long a user can be logged in before they will be required to re-authenticate. This includes all devices a user is logged in on.
----
Changing default session duration
Notion has a default session duration of 90 days, but workspace owners can change this to a number of options from 1 hour to 90 days
Log out all users —force all users to log out immediately.
Reset passwords for all users —force all users to reset their passwords.
Dashboard of managed users
Click theView dashboardbutton to get an overview of all users in your verified domain. There, you’ll find information about each user, like their name, email address, workspaces, last activity date, and two-step authentication status.
Within each specific user account in this dashboard, workspace owners can perform the following actions:
Suspend users
Delete users
Change user's name and email address
----
Note: The new email must belong to the verified domain
Log out users
Reset passwords
Remove user from external workspaces
In addition to being a prerequisite to configure SAML SSO on Notion, once you’ve verified a domain, you can regulate and manage workspaces that belong to your verified domain(s). To do so, clickBrowse workspacesunderSettings & members > Identity & provisioning > Domain Management.
To help mitigate concerns and confusion for future users, after a domain is verified, every time a new workspace is created using the verified domain, an email notification will be sent to the respective workspace owner alerting them that their workspace is eligible for domain management.
Initially verifying your domain
----
When you first verify a domain, there’s a 14-day notification period to inform all users that belong to that domain that their workspace(s) are eligible for domain management actions by their Enterprise workspace owners. During this period, you will not be able to act on any of the workspaces in the domain management view.
To help regulate the workspaces created using your verified domain, you can customize the permissions for who can create workspaces underIdentity & provisioning > Domain management > Workspace creationand select Only workspace owners.
This setting only applies to workspace owners from the primary domain-verified workspace.
----
Once a domain is verified, Enterprise workspace owners can clickBrowse workspacesto view all non-Enterprise workspaces that users have created with their verified domain.There will be a tab for single member and multi-member workspaces. The following information will be provided in the view for each workspace:
Workspace name
Plan type
Number of members
Workspace owners
Created at
Created by
The actions available will show on the far right side.
In the single member tab in the workspace view, you will see all the personal workspaces that have been created using your verified domain.
----
For some customers to meet compliance requirements, they don’t want any work projects being stored in single member (personal) workspaces. In the workspace view, you will see the option toRequire account changenext to each single member workspace. This will require that the owner of the single member workspace provide a non-corporate email address for the user account before they can access the workspace again. This is a great option for employees that may have created a single member workspace with their company email, but mostly have non-work projects they’d like to keep for personal use . As a best practice, we recommend working with the respective workspace owners and to move any work related pages to a sanctioned Enterprise workspace prior to requiring the account owner change.
----
To help clean up stale single member workspaces that were owned by a former employee, you can delete the workspace from the workspace view underDomain Management.
When you delete a workspace, an email notification will be sent to the respective workspace owner informing them of this and providing your email address as the contact for any questions. Users will have the option for a one-time-only extension on the deletion period for an additional 30 days.
Domain management support
Notion’s support team cannot override any domain management actions by Enterprise workspace owners. If a user reaches out to Notion with questions, we will provide the email of the Enterprise workspace owner so the user can reach out directly.
----
If needed, the workspace can be restored by the Enterprise workspace owner in the domain management view within 30 days.
The following content can not be recovered:
Favorites
Guest access
Configured integrations (Bots)
Domains (custom Notion domains)
If the single member workspace is associated with a current employee, we advise caution before deleting the workspace in case it would be better toRequire account changeto a non-corporate email address and preserve the workspace settings.
In the multi-member tab in the workspace view, you will see all the Plus and Business plan workspaces that are eligible to claim:
Workspace was created using your verified domain
----
Has at least one workspace owner (could be the creator or another workspace owner) still in the workspace that belongs to your verified domain
Not on the Enterprise plan
To help establish governance over authorized workspaces, you can claim ownership of eligible workspaces and upgrade them to the Enterprise plan. When the claim has been successfully processed:
Invoice will be sent to the billing contact provided for the Enterprise upgrade
Workspace owner that claimed the workspace will become the only workspace owner
Previous workspace owners are downgraded to members (workspace owners can re-assign roles and permissions as necessary)
----
Other than the new primary workspace owner, there will be no noticeable difference for the workspace members.
Reminder to assign Membership Admins on claimed workspaces as needed to manage members and groups.
After claiming ownership of your workspaces and adding them to your Enterprise license, you may want to consider consolidating your users and content. Consolidating into a single, primary workspace (or small set of production workspaces) adds two primary benefits:
Standard and secure admin controls:With all users and content in one place, it's easier to streamline admin controls and user management, instead of managing both across multiple workspaces.
----
More discoverable content and collaboration:Since content will live in one workspace, it will be easier for users to find and access all of the content they need and collaborate in a single tool.
You can request a consolidation through your dedicated Account Management team. If you don’t have a dedicated Account Manager, you can reach out to our Support team at team@makenotion.com for more information.
Enterprise workspace owners have access to additional data and reporting for greater insights into content and overall workspace usage. Whether you’re looking to export information, track and audit events, or search existing content, there are options available to help you do so.

How to create a content calendar for your marketing team
A good content calendar can be your marketing team's most important project management tool. As a marketer, you're pulled in many directions but still need to track projects you already have in the works. Help your team stay on top of deadlines and on the same page with a content calendar that can adapt to many different types of projects and needs.
Using Notion, you can bring your content strategy, publishing schedule, and content assets into one place.
To build one database that schedules and tracks the status of content.
To customize your calendar to provide the most relevant information to your team, add whatever project work you need to pages and keep everything on deadline.
----
Best practices from the Notion marketing team for better content management.
If you'd like, you canuse this content calendar template. Or follow along and after reading, you'll be able to create a editorial calendar that looks like this:
Better databases have arrived!
While the concepts outlined in this guide are still useful, references to specific product actions may be a bit outdated! Databases were redesigned in March 2022, so your experience may differ slightly from what’s pictured and described here.This guideoutlines the new database features, including what's changed.
----
Keep marketing on message. Manage your bloggers. Stay aligned with sales. Stick to your content cadence across channels. You need to tackle these challenges to hit your big goals. But content too often runs into trouble because of:
Poor communication— marketers get input from everywhere. Feedback from engineering on product positioning, input from design on blog visuals. These conversations aren’t documented in a single spot leading to miscommunication and project delays.
----
No vision into all the content you’re producing— because new content comes in many forms (blog content, videos, social media posts, etc.) it’s easy for digital marketing managers to miss the forest through the trees. Strategy becomes unclear, leaving you and your team without an obvious path to meet goals.
Fixed systems that diminish your team's potential— you’re creating all kinds of content. A rigid system is only slowing your team down. You need functionality in software, something adjustable to each project and person on your content team.
In Notion, you can:
----
Have one space for everything— blogs, videos, webinars, social media and any other pieces of content can all live in a single calendar. Beyond knowing each project’s status, you can also keep creative briefs, strategy docs, assets and feedback in one place. Then your team can focus on driving results instead of searching email threads.
Produce consistent, high-quality content— help your team execute on-brand for the different types of content they’re creating. Set a process and provide important materials like brainstorm frameworks or style guides every time, arming your team to keep things consistent across the board.
----
Customize project work and tracking— you can not only create custom ways for tracking the status or who’s working on a project, but also customize all the components of these projects based on their specific needs.
Whether you’re an in-house marketer or content marketing consultant with a dozen clients, all your planning and management can come together here.Instead of a static calendar tool that points you to the work (which probably lives across many tools), this system serves dual purposes — allowing all your content creation to happen in the same place you're tracking it.
----
In Notion, you can create different types of databases including a table, calendar, list and board. In this case, we'll be looking at first establishing a content calendar using a board.
Create a board database—to see all the things you can add to a Notion page, hit/. We call this the slash command. On your marketing team’s homepage, you can create a specific page for your content calendar by typing/boardand selectingBoard-Full page. This will open up a page for your content calendar. Then you can get started adding individual blogs, podcasts, social posts and more to map out your content schedule.
----
With boards, team members can stay in the loop by quickly seeing the status of work based on which column it’s under. Each page thumbnail represents a project. Simply drag that content into a new column to update the status.
Add properties—for every page in your content calendar, you can assign properties that show project-specific information. ClickPropertiesat the top right of your list, then+Add a property. Choose the property type and give it a name. A few examples:
Writerfor aPersonproperty to tag someone to complete that task.
Deadlinefor aDateproperty to add important dates and stay ahead of deadlines.
Typefor aSelectproperty to tag blog posts, videos, social media updates, etc.
----
You could even have aCheckboxproperty calledSEO Checklistto confirm that each piece uses SEO best practices such as structured URLs and keyword-optimized meta descriptions.
Create and customize as many properties as you want. Learn all about property typeshere.
One size doesn’t fit all marketing campaigns. Here's how you can tailor your Notion calendar to fit each project:
----
Show properties in your cards—see at a glance what's most relevant to you. Instead of clicking into cards to see their properties, you can display the most relevant information right on cards in your board. In an instant, get a view of the projects your team is working on, who owns them and any other properties you want. On the top right of your calendar, click•••and hitProperties. Toggle the ones you want visible in your board view.
Grouping your board differently—the columns in your board can be grouped based on a few of the properties you select. Maybe you want to see who’s blogging this week, or group the content by type. HitGroup byon the top of your board to change the columns.
----
Custom views for different needs—save views into your database that match different workflows. On your content calendar, click+Add a viewat the top left. Select the view type. Then name your new view. You can use different filters and sorts to organize the content in this view, making as many different views as you need. Maybe you want to see only work for this week’s product launches, or only your social media content calendar. Make views for each, and you can instantly pull them up whenever you need them.
Here are a few custom views recommended for your content calendar
Click to expand
----
Entries in your content calendar can be blog posts, press releases, YouTube storyboards, podcast transcripts or just about anything, really. Every page (represented as a card on your board) can be opened and customized to become whatever you need it to be.
Instead of a bunch of links sending you to the far reaches of the internet to do your work, Notion connects your vital information and documents together.
Here’s how you can customize pages in a few different ways:
Headers— like your published content, your pages deserve a little visual hierarchy too. Format pages to make them easier to read. Choose fromH1(the largest),H2orH3. Type three dashes in a row to make a page break.
----
Drag-and-drop— using the⋮⋮icon, move anything around your pages and even create columns. Links, text, images, mp3 files, organize nearly anything however you'd like. Make your Notion page look like your favorite blog.
Pages inside of pages— you can nest pages inside of your project pages. Whether it's an archive of previous blog posts or a collection of citations, each can be neatly organized on a page. Type/pageinside of your page to create a subpage to organize everything you need for a piece of content.
Comments— cut down on email threads and keep track of all feedback on any piece of content by adding discussions and comments, and opening them up to your whole team.
----
Kick-off any campaigns and streamline content production with templates. Whether it’s a tweet or a sponsored post, you can make sure your content is on point using specific templates.
To create a template, look at the right side of your board and click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton. Select+New template. A blank page will pop up. This is where you'll create the template once, so you can use it again.
----
Creative brief— start any campaign on the right foot. Briefs can be especially handy for agencies working with different clients. Under an "Overview"H2header, you can includeH3headers for "Objective" and "Brand Guidelines." Under a "Project"H2header, you can includeH3headers for "Campaign Elements" and "Target Audience." Consider also anH2for "Success Criteria" so your marketing team can track goals.
Outline— outline any articles, videos and other content to ensure it hits on all your major points. You can also treat outlines as a collaborative process. Bring other teammates into an outline’s development by tagging them. Provide background information on the content’s goals. You can include your style guide or reference links, too.
----
Content-specific pages— build out templates depending on the content type to simplify workflows. Create sections in a podcast template page dedicated to interview questions, editing notes, YouTube metadata and recordings. Or put together your shot list, script and other pre-production documents in one handy place starting with a video template page. A blog template can contain content ideas, research, a draft of the article, and all edits.
You can update a base template anytime by clicking the down arrow next toNew. Then click the•••next to the template and clickEdit.
----
Notion templates give you the ability to provide clear guidance on your content marketing strategy that your team or a business partner can follow — but once inside, there’s still enough flexibility that you or your team can work their way.
Remember we said you can make Notion pages look like your favorite blog? You can also publish pages to the web for anyone to read.
When you’re ready to share your Notion page with the world, clickShareon the top right.
Toggle onShare to the web. ClickCopy Linkand anyone with the link can view this Notion page.
You can also toggleSearch engine indexingto make your page eventually discoverable on Google.
Keep in mind you can even use Notion to build a website or resume. Learn howhere.

Content Marketer Nate Martins uses this content calendar to collaborate and stay on top of deadlines.
"As a team, we're working on so many different kinds of content. Having it all in one place allows us to have a clear marketing strategy, while views give slices of that based on what we need at any time,” he says. “Instead of wondering where a draft of something is or when something's going to launch, everyone on our team can go right to the source."
Here are a few content management tips from our marketing team:
----
Create a view of your marketing calendar in your team's wiki— at Notion, we have a view of the content calendar showing content going live this week. We keep it at the top of our team'swikiso we're all aligned on all marketing efforts and what's coming out. This is called a linked database. Learn how to add onehere.
Relate content and social media databases— we have one database for all our content and another for social media. One column in these databases is relational, meaning they’re connected. If we’re launching a new video, we can see all the tweets, Instagram and LinkedIn posts we plan on publishing to support that video. Learn how to do ithere.
----
We have internal and external deadlines (and views for each of these)— having both deadlines keeps our eyes on the prize. We're focused on execution, and the internal deadline ensures we're meeting that external due date every time.

This notes & docs system makes your design team more efficient
Great design teams work with a full field of vision. Without places to collect notes for a product feature spec or from a weekly standup with engineering, important decision-making context might as well live on the backside of a napkin, easily lost and impossible to reference.
The real key is having a system that bakes documentation into everything you do. That prompts you to build knowledge over time so you're always getting better together.
----
Here, we'll walk you through building two note-taking systems tailored specifically to designers in Notion — one for meetings and one for all your documents.As we've seen across dozens of companies using this approach, they'll help your team save time, lead to more in-sync work, and result in a more thoughtfully-designed end product.
To create databases Meeting Notes and Docs, and to use them to unite your team.
To organize these databases with tags so you can quickly find what you need.
Best practices from the Notion design team for high-impact note-taking.
Soon, you'll be able to create documentation for your design system that looks like this:
----
Design decisions aren't made in a vacuum. Your Meeting Notes and Docs systems become arenas where you'll share notes and ideas, so that information is transparent, learnings compound, and handoffs are seamless.
In Notion, your design team's Meeting Notes and Docs systems can organize:
Notes from every meeting— standups, project syncs and breakouts for smaller groups can be tagged and organized however's best for your team.
Project proposals— share detailed thoughts on how to build a new feature and get fast, written feedback from your team
----
Memos, plans and processes— if you're updating team structure or augmenting a design process, your team knows exactly where to go to get this information. Think about how you kick off projects for example, you can make sure each one is approached thoughtfully.
How does this help your team?
Increased transparency— even if someone wasn't in the room (or the same time zone) for a meeting, they'll feel included and get the context they need to contribute from the notes.
More effective collaboration— understand decision rationales (either from a meeting or for a project), save time, and stay aligned because everyone has the "why" behind the "how."
----
Consistent quality— when everyone is working off the same playbook, they can solve problems in similar ways and hit a consistent bar.
Notion makes it easy to collect, organize and customize this information so your team actually uses it.Instead of doc graveyards or fragmented notes from meetings no one ever looks at again, a documentation system becomes both your long-term and short-term memory, turning writing into clear action.
Meeting Notes and Docs are different houses built on the same foundation. Here's how you can create both, with concrete recommendations for designers to get the most out of each one.
----
Notion offers several different types of databases: tables, boards, calendars, etc. Here we'll use a list database — a sleek, minimalist collection of individual pages, easy to open and label.
Hitting/brings up a menu of options for what you can add to a Notion page — we call this the "slash command."
To make a list, when you’re in a page type/listand scroll down toList - Full page
from the options menu. This will create a new page that is only your list and nothing else (you can also show a list inside a page by selectingList - Inline).
You'll see we've started you off with blank pages in the list. Click on one to edit it, or remove it by hovering over the page and clicking on the⋮⋮icon to the left, and choosingDelete.
----
You can hit+ Newto add a new page to the list.
Try rearranging the pages. Using⋮⋮, grab a page and drag it in whatever order you'd like.
You'll create two of these lists, one for Meeting Notes and another for Docs.
The pages in these lists will become weekly design meeting notes, or where designers can submit ideas for product improvements. Anyone on your design team can access them — seeding a culture of transparency and collaboration.
For both your Meeting Notes and Docs lists, huge indexes can get unruly.
----
Notion makes them easy to parse and organize. In your Meeting Notes list, maybe you want a view of only standups, or only meetings related to a brand redesign project. In your Docs list, you may want to see the status of a doc as it moves through your process rendered on a Kanban board.You only have to create a database once. Notion makes it possible to view that information any way that's most helpful in the moment.
Add sorting and filtering capabilities like this:
----
Add properties to your pages— inside your list's pages, you'll see properties. These are attributes about each page, like date created, who was in a meeting, what type of meeting it was, etc. ClickPropertiesat the top right of your database to see existing properties and add new ones. For each one, choose the type you want and give it a name. You might use theSelectproperty and call it “Type” to create tags for "Weekly Standup" in your Meeting Notes list. You can use thePersonproperty to tag all participants.
----
Show properties in list view— also in thePropertiesmenu, you can decide which ones appear in your list itself. Toggle on the ones you want to show in your list view. With one glance, you'll be able to see things like the type of doc or meeting, who created it and when it was last updated. You don't have to click into any pages to know what's going on.
----
Create a filter— to see only a sub-segment of your notes or docs that fit certain criteria. ClickFilterat the top right, and hit+ Add a filter. Filter based on the database properties you've created. For example, in your Meeting Notes list, you can filter the Type property to see only retros. In your Docs list, you can filter to see only proposals for new features. The filter is your oyster. You can set it so only pearls float to the surface.
----
Sort your list— to put your pages in a useful order. ClickSort, then+ Add a sort, then choose a property to put in ascending or descending order. This is especially useful if you want to see your Docs arranged from freshest to oldest. Choose theLast editedproperty andDescending. The pages most recently touched will be at the top for easy access.
----
Add views— you don't have to re-apply a filter or sort every time you want to see certain things in a list. Instead, create a permanent view that you can switch to any time. This also lets you change the format for your data, letting you view it as a table, board, calendar, etc. if you need to. Click+ Add a viewat the upper left corner of your database, choose the format you want, give it a name, and hitCreate.Then apply whatever filter or sort you want. For your design Docs, you can create a list view filtered to only show specs. Or you can make a view to see docs authored by each of your teammates displayed on a board. Most importantly, you can flip back and forth between all of these instantly — just like changing a TV channel.
----
Sorting, filtering and viewing options put the power in your hands to organize your Meeting Notes and Docs lists however's best for you — or another member of your team.You can have views based on an employee or specific team for complete customization of all your notes and docs.
Moreproperties & views for your design Docs
Properties can help organize your list of documents and make them more manageable. Here are a few our design team uses:
Type of doc— oneSelectproperty always has "Design." But then we have anotherSelectproperty that drills down further into what type of design document it was, like "UX Research."
----
Status— anotherSelectproperty, where tags denote what further action is needed on each document. Ours include "Work in Progress," "Open for Comments," and "Implemented."
Priority— aSelectproperty with tags like "Low," "Medium," and "High."
Views also make it easy for us to focus on the work in front of us. Here are a few we use:
By type— this is a board view, which groups documents into "Type" columns.
By author— see all the docs created by one of your designers.
By status— another board view that uses the status as the column, grouping your docs by where they're at in your process.
Moreproperties & views for your design Meeting Notes
----
Similarly, properties for your Meeting Notes help denote what type of meeting you had, who was in it, and when it happened. Here are some we use:
Type of meeting— using theSelectproperty, you can create tags based on what type of meeting was held. Try "Design Standup," "Monthly Engineering & Design Sync," and "Retro."
Participants— using thePeopleproperty, tag who was in the meeting.
Date— theCreated timeproperty automatically records the day and time of the meeting. For views, you can leverage all the properties you've included in these notes.
Here are a few ways we organize our own Meeting Notes into different views:
By date created— this helps you bring the most recent meetings to the top.
----
By type of meeting— create different views for the different types of meetings you have. That way, you can see all the meetings about the app redesign you have coming up, or what product features your engineering and design teams decided upon in their monthly meeting.
Notion pages are blank slates — they can be anything, like notes from a full retro on a completed project or a collection of design inspiration. Notion is like a set of power tools, allowing you to build anything you need to help your design team work better.
First, here are a few tips to structure your pages. Notes and docs become ultra-flexible and easy to read with a few small touches.
----
Headers— use these to make your pages neat and tidy, choosing from different sizes likeH1(the largest),H2andH3(the smallest). For a project spec, headers might include “Problem statement," "Goals," and "Screenshot examples." For a set of meeting notes, headers might be "Agenda" and "Discussion items."
Drag-and-drop— seriously, you can move anything around in these pages. Hover over what you'd like to move and grab⋮⋮. You can create columns by dragging something all the way to the right (the blue guides will help). For example, if your design team is working on a new dropdown menu, place an example image on the left, and bulleted notes about it on the right.
----
Now, you can incorporate design elements to take your notes to the next level. Remember the slash command? Use it to access a full list of embeds you can include in any page.
Here's what might be particularly useful to your design team:
Images, videos & gifs— so you can upload a photo of the whiteboard from a recent brainstorming session or a video explainer about new tools you want to integrate.
Figma & Invision projects— so your team can access design drafts without having to bounce around different software, which is really helpful for gathering feedback from cross-functional teams that can easily use Notion but not other tools.
Framer prototypes— so you can see your design work in action and collaborate with the UX team in once place.
----
Whimsical & Miro boards— so your design lead can see your thought process in flowcharts or diagrams during a final review.
Abstract projects— so you can see all version histories of a project and pull one out of the archive if necessary.
To access these embeds, simply type/and navigate the menu. To get there faster, you can type the name — for example/figmaor/miro.
Context switching, forgetting ideas, siloed info in different tools...these could be things of the past for your design team.Notion's malleability encourages more note-taking — it also makes notes actionable because they can live side-by-side with your actual work.
----
For meetings or docs that your team repeats all the time — like weekly standups, or project kickoffs — you can add a re-usable template to your databases.Instead of remaking headers, sections, checklists and more, a template gives you exactly the format you need instantly.
To add a template, click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton on the right side of your list and select+ New template. The blank page that pops up is a template you can define once and use again and again.
Here are a few ideas for templates to use in your Docs and Meeting Notes:
For Meeting Notes
----
Weekly standups— you can create headers for "Agenda" or "Action items," things that'll likely be part of every meeting. Using theSelectproperty type, create a tag for "Weekly Standup." Then using thePersonproperty, tag its usual attendees. Whenever you use this template, everything from the text to the properties will be recreated with a single click.
Retros & post-mortems— again, use aSelectproperty, create a "Retro" or "Post-Mortem" tag. Inside the template, you can have headers for "Problem," "Screenshots," and "Proposed solution," so every problem you encounter is analyzed using the same set of criteria.
----
Syncs about specific projects— use theSelectproperty to create tags based on the project, like "Website Banner Redesign." ThePersonproperty can be used to tag the meeting's regular participants here too.
For Docs
For Docs, templates allow you to put a system in place that's followed by all of your designers, helping standardize processes across the team.
----
Feature RFC— a system we use at Notion called "Request for Comment," which opens up an idea for team commentary. Using theSelectproperty type, create a tag for "Feature RFC." Include headers like "Problem," "Necessary context," "Proposed solution" and "Action items." You can also add text under each of these that includes instructions for your team so everyone can use conduct likeminded analysis.
----
Project kickoff— your design team will probably have many projects, so this template can help ensure you're all thinking similarly. Use theSelectproperty to create a tag for "Project Kickoff." You can use anotherSelectproperty and leave that blank — this is where you'll create new tags depending on the project. Headers here can include "Goals" with checkboxes underneath, and "Competitor analysis" with a prompt for screenshots.
User interview— it's important to stay connected with your users. Use theSelectproperty to create a "User Interview" tag. Inside the body of the page, add headers for background information, questions asked, responses, and conclusions.
----
When asked how Notion manages its documentation system, designer Cory Etzkorn says, “Writing documentation is critical for scaling a design system and brand. It makes employee onboarding painless and decision-making more transparent.”
Documentation is critical to our designers' success — particularly because they sit on different teams. Our Meeting Notes list helps maintain transparency, so everyone can feel like they're involved in a meeting, even if they weren't there. And our Docs list helps our designers collaborate with our product team, because they can share ideas in a single place.Our work becomes more efficient because there's a written account of everything we do.
----
Here are a few tricks we've learned to manage your design team's note-taking system:
Require documentation in a specific place— getting your designers to write everything down will help build a culture of documentation and learning. Whether it's an idea about a product improvement or a quick project sync between engineering and design teams, all this information is valuable. And ensuring all of this has a specific home makes knowledge centrally available to everyone.
----
Link to Meeting Notes and Docs from your team's homepage— managing everything in Notion lets you create homes for every team in your org. Design canhave its own homepagewith all relevant team info, with pages like "Brand Assets" and "Inspiration." You can link to your Meeting Notes or Docs lists here to make them easily accessible. Drag them from your sidebar into your design homepage or wiki and they become links in the design section of your Notion workspace.
----
Drag a page out of your list— most documents will stay in your list. But, in your Docs list, if you've created an RFC for a new brand font, got all the feedback, and worked on the project in that page, you can now move it into your team's wiki so everyone can start using it. Use⋮⋮to drag-and-drop this page into another section in your sidebar, or from the⋮⋮menu, selectMove toand choose where you want it to go.

This project management system connects the dots for your product team
Product managers are the source of truth for every project. But it takes hard work to arrive at that truth. PMs must account for different teams and user research and processes and prototypes, the list goes on. So product teams need a system to centralize all their cross-functional work — not just for them, but to connect and communicate with their many stakeholders.
Here, we'll show you, step-by-step, how to build a project management and roadmapping system in Notion tailored specifically to product managers.We've seen it work for dozens of teams that consistently ship high-quality products faster.
Better databases have arrived!
----
While the concepts outlined in this guide are still useful, references to specific product actions may be a bit outdated! Databases were redesigned in March 2022, so your experience may differ slightly from what’s pictured and described here.This guideoutlines the new database features, including what's changed.
To create a database for project management and roadmapping that unites all teams (engineering, design, sales, marketing, etc.) and makes work transparent.
To organize and customize this database to meet your team's needs and surface relevant information.
Best practices from the Notion product team for better project management.
By the end, you'll be able to build aproject management systemthat looks like this:
----
Whether it's adjusting timelines or gathering feedback from many sources, product managers face a unique set of problems when it comes to project management. If cracks in your system aren't sealed, you might ship something that doesn't meet your quality bar. The most common of these cracks include:
Dispersed, inaccessible information— working cross-functionally, it's difficult to collect and share all drafts, feedback and context that's siloed in tools specific to different functions (think Figma for designers or Jira for engineers).
----
Lack of transparency for your team (and org-wide)— top-level information, like who owns a project and who's working on it, isn't clearly communicated by your system because there isn't a single place to access it all. This also means those outside the team don't know where to go if they have questions.
Rigid systems that inhibit your process— don't let software's limitations define your process. You should be able to mold software to your needs instead of shoehorning information into it.
In Notion, you can create a custom project management and roadmapping system that puts all the information from the teams you're working with front and center.
----
One place for all project management & work— along with knowing the status of a project, everything from notes to design mockups to feedback is in one place, so your team doesn't miss a thing.
See all important project info at a glance— metadata for every project, like owners, deadlines, and sprints can be viewed right in your database, so you get an instant download of where everything stands.
Customize the system to meet your needs— establish a process all your PMs follow while giving them the flexibility to shape how they work individually, leading to more effective work instead of project management overhead.
----
This project management and roadmapping system can be the foundation for your product team's growth.Because Notion is both structured and malleable, the tools you build in it grow with you as you add more teammates or change the way you do things.
No matter your team's size or the number of projects you're tackling, all your product work starts here. Here's how to set it up, with recommendations tailored to busy PMs.
You can make a number of different databases in Notion: lists, tables, calendars, etc. But here, we'll focus on creating a board, which is a collection of individuals project pages you can move from one stage of a process to the next.
----
By typing/, you'll get a menu of what you can add to a Notion page. We call this the "slash command," a universal menu of everything you can do in Notion.
To create your board, type/boardand selectBoard - Full page. A completely new page that's just your board will pop up.
At the top of your board are columns. You can change these to reflect each phase in your product team's process. We've set you up with the basics: "Not started," "In progress," and "Complete." You can customize them to your specific needs.
----
In your board, you'll see a few cards. Each one can be a project. And inside each card, you'll see several different properties, which are important because you'll organize your board based on them. For instance, you can have a date property to capture projects' due dates. You can have a person property to capture stakeholders. You can even add tags to denote which team owns the project or what type of project it is.
To add a property to your board, click+Add a property. You'll be prompted to give it a name and choose the type of property you want.
----
You can group your board by any property by clicking•••at the top right of your board and selectingGroup By. For example, group your board by project owners to see all projects organized underneath the people responsible for them.
Go ahead and grab a card and move it from one column to the next. Now visualize yourself moving every project into the "Complete" column. Feels good, right?
This board is the foundation for getting things done as a group. Each of its structural components are important to what you're building — columns for your process, cards for project info, properties for organization.
----
And because all projects live in one place, anyone can see their status. You're creating a window of transparency for both your team and for the entire organization.
Every product team works differently. Using Notion, you can create a project management and roadmapping system that matches your team's workflow. Here are a couple tips for doing that:
----
Show properties in your board view— instead of clicking into cards to see all their properties, you can display the most relevant ones right on cards in your board. In an instant, you can get a view of the projects your team is working on, their priority, who owns them, and any other properties you want at your fingertips. On the top right of your table, click•••and hitProperties. Toggle the ones you want displayed in your board view. To rearrange them, use the⋮⋮icon.
----
Create different views— Notion allows you to slice the same dataset many ways. You can have a view of your database that's only projects launching this week. You can have one for projects you're collaborating with the design team on. You can have another for only mobile projects. Best of all, you can immediately toggle between them.
To do this, click+ Add a viewnear your board's title. Then select the type of database you want, name it, and hitCreate. You can view your board as a table too, or as a calendar showing when you're working on what.
----
You can now apply different filters to surface only information you want and need. ClickFilterthen+ Add a filter. Maybe you want to see only P1 projects related to your desktop app. You can filter to see just those. Then you can hitSortand+ Add a sortto organize them by launch date. Views preserve the filters or sorts you apply, so you don't have to recreate them every time.
To switch between views you've created, simply click that same view menu. They're all there! This opens up a lot of potential. Every team your board connects could create a view of just their tasks so they're easier to see. Even individuals could create their own task boards (giving everyone visibility into their priorities).
----

With Notion's customizability, you become a toolmaker. And this project management and roadmapping system is your do-anything Swiss Army Knife.It's a single database that serves many purposes — from a list of projects completed in Q2, to every meeting sales has scheduled, to every design asset, to every marketing campaign, to a calendar of this week's product updates. All in one place.
Properties and views just for product teams
Click to expand
Now that you have a system for managing projects, let's turn our attention to the cards on your board. This is where you'll house all the information related to your projects.
----
Because PMs work so cross-functionally, they juggle every tool used by the teams they're collaborating with.Engineers, designers, and marketers all use unique software. Even feedback is tucked away in these tools, making it hard to find, like buried treasure without a map.
In Notion, all teams, tools, and commentary for a project come together. This creates more effective communication and streamlined work — instead of your PMs shuffling through software to make sure everything is accounted for.
----
Customize every page— every project requires different documentation, organized so it's easy to navigate and use. Notion gives PMs just enough flexibility to arrange information that suits the current task. For instance, by typing/heading, you can select fromH1,H2, orH3headers. Then, using the⋮⋮icon, you can drag-and-drop images, text, sub-pages and more under these headers. This tidies up all the info in pages and makes it digestible.
----
Embeds just for product teams— bring all your team's tools together in one place for effective work. Engineers can share a code snippet by typing/code. Designers can embed prototypes by typing/figmaor/invision. You can even include a feedback form with/typeform. As a PM, you can create a better, more collaborative working environment because Notion supports many tools your team is using.
Pages inside of pages— you can nest pages inside of your project pages infinitely. Whether it's an archive of previous design iterations from designers, or a collection of user interviews, each can be neatly organized in a page. This gives your product team a way to collect all the information for a project, from spec to launch, and organize it cleanly.
----
Real-time feedback— using the@symbol, you can tag teammates in comments and discussions to collaborate. Tag a designer to review your new dropdown menu or a copywriter to approve final text. For PMs, collating feedback in one place ensures it's acted upon and that everyone's looped into conversations (especially helpful while remote).
Everything about comments and discussions in a 4-minute video here 👇
----
Make decisions with full context— inside your pages, you can have a living thought process for every step of a project, from old design specs to meeting notes. That way, there's full understanding of why a certain aspect of a project was put on hold, or why one design was chosen over another. You can even include test results or user feedback. With end-to-end clarity of what happened, you can chart the path for what happens next.
Notion gives you the structure to set a process your product team follows — but also enough flexibility that they can work their own way from project to project.
----
Your project management and roadmapping system sets the process your product team will follow from a high level. Templates make it even more granular.Every project has a unique set of considerations, and templates help ensure PMs capture them. Define and use the same formats again and again for authoring specs, conducting user interviews, and more.
Templates help create a hive mind for your team, where they're able to operate off the same principles when starting any new process.
----
To create a template, look at the right side of your board and click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton. Select+ New template. A blank page will pop up. This is where you'll create the template once, then use it repeatedly (don't worry, you can update it whenever).
For product teams specifically, here are a few ideas for templates:
Project spec— used to start any project, this template helps ensure your PMs are considering its entire scope. Under an "Overview"H2header, you can includeH3headers for "Problem Statement" and "Proposed Work." Under a "Dependencies & Risks"H2header, you can includeH3headers for "Stakeholders" and "Risks." You should also have anH2for "Success Criteria" so your product team can track goals.

User interview— it's important to maintain a solid relationship with your users. This template helps your product managers get the most from all these interviews. Be sure to include anEmailorPhoneproperty here, so you record the user's contact info. In the body of the template, you can have differentH2headers for "User Feedback," "Interview Observations," and "Action Items." You can even include a list of questions that have proven useful and make them standard across your team.
----
RFC— also called "request for comment," this is a type of page we use at Notion to solicit team feedback. In yourSelectproperty for the project "Type," make a tag for "RFC." You should also have anotherSelectproperty for "Status," where you can add tags for "Open for Comment," "In Progress" and "Archived." Use aPeopleproperty titled "Reviewers" to assign the folks responsible for giving you feedback. You can then create headers for specs or code blocks, and prompt your reviewers to leave comments. When you're ready, share the link to this on Slack with your team.
----
It's easy to see how templates help your team cement processes. But they also help your team grow.New PMs can see how your team works and start following this thought process instantly. And when their fresh eyes see something you forgot to include? You can update any template with a click, and start using it widely.
One of Notion's most powerful features is the ability to connect information across databases. Using aRelationproperty, you can sync all the meeting notes or tasks related to a project right inside that project's card.
----
This is where Notion shines — once your entire company is using it, you can begin connecting what were once disparate project pieces in a single place. No more searching endlessly for that one document you need. Everything is bundled together for easy access.
Here's how to set this up:
You'll want to make a Task List for either your entire company or specific teams. You can usethis templateto get started. With it, you'll have a list of everyone's tasks, which you can then assign to the larger projects they're related to.
----
Another good thing to fold into your projects are all relevant meeting notes.Here's a templateyou can use to make a company (or team)-wide Meeting Notes system. We've also created specific meeting notes & docs recommendations forengineeringanddesignteams.
Great. Now you have two databases for Tasks and Meeting Notes. In your project management and roadmapping system, add aRelationproperty and title it "Tasks." You'll be prompted to select a database — choose your Task List. Then do the same for Meeting Notes. You'll now be able to link any pages from these databases in your cards.
----
Let's say you have a project to improve commenting on your mobile app. You'd go to your Task List and create all the tasks needed to complete that project. Then, in the your card for the Improve Commenting on Mobile project, you can link all the tasks that roll up into that project, like "Comment Suggestions" or "Copy and Paste Capabilities." You can also sync all meeting notes about the project, like from the standup you have with engineering and design teams working on the feature.
----
In your Task List or Meeting Notes databases, you can create aRelationproperty titled "Project," which allows you to sync both ways. Whenever you have a meeting, tag the project you talked about in the notes. Any updates you make in the Task List or Meeting Notes databases will be reflected in your project management and roadmapping system.
Another usefulRelationproperty? "User Research." If you build a separate database to keep track of user interviews, you can connect them to your projects. Anytime you conduct a user interview that might be beneficial for a specific project, just link it inside that project's card so you have full context from the people using it most.

Product designer Ryo Lu uses our project management system to collaborate cross-functionally. "Teams can use project pages as a single source of truth to track projects down to related tasks, docs and notes — all in one place," he says. "Most importantly, this system breaks down team and app silos so everyone in the company has clarity and knows what's going on."
Here are a few tips our product team uses to manage projects with a single system:
----
Add a view of your project board in your product team's wiki— ourproduct team's wikiis its home base. It has all the important documents and information that team needs to work. It's been very helpful to have a view of their projects board at the top of this page, with everything launching each week. This helps with transparency, especially at the company-wide level, and keeps the product team aligned around goals.
----
To add this type of view to your wiki, type/linkand chooseCreate linked database. Then, search for your projects board. After it pops up on your page, click+ Add a view, making a table titled "This Week." You can then filter, choosing your property that denotes ship date, selectingis onorafterandExact date(adjusting this every Monday).
----
Feedback tags help prioritize projects— Our product team works in lockstep with our customer support team to understand users' problems. To make this possible, the customer support team maintains a database of user feature requests and issues, each tagged by feature, need, or topic. This makes it easy to see which features are the most wanted, and that information gets piped into our product roadmap via aRelationproperty so we can constantly make decisions about what to build next with intuition directly from our customer
----
Views for each sub-team— our product team is broken down into smaller sub-teams, each responsible for working on different parts of the product, like "Mobile," "Enterprise," and "Infrastructure." Each team has its own page in ourengineering wiki, and inside these pages is a view of our shared projects board, filtered just for initiatives that team is handling. This keeps everyone informed about what's getting done and what's coming next.

This project management system helps your engineering team track every initiative
The bestproject management systemcatches everything — it communicates who's responsible for what, shows where everything stands, and surfaces dependencies and edge cases.
This is especially true for engineering projects, because they directly impact the entire company. It's essential to have a proven, scalable system to execute these nuanced, complex initiatives. And as your team grows, when engineers are focused on their individual work, they'll also need full knowledge of assignments, timelines, development stages, and scope.
----
Here, we'll walk you through building a project management and roadmapping system tailored specifically for engineers (we use one like it at Notion).As we've seen across dozens of engineering teams, it'll help you track projects, ensure everyone's on the same page, and provide company-wide visibility into your work.
To create a database for project management and roadmapping that's efficient and transparent.
To organize that database with tags and views so you can quickly find what you need.
Best practices from the Notion engineering team for effective project tracking.
Soon, you'll be able to create a roadmap for your engineering projects that looks like this:
----
Not only do engineering projects impact the whole company — more importantly, they impact users. Your team is operating in a high-stakes environment.If deadlines slip or buggy products launch, there are major implications internally and externally.
In Notion, your team's project management and roadmapping system can:
Track the status of every project— bugs, tasks, sprints and large projects can be easily moved from one stage to the next with complete visibility.
Organize all the relevant materials for that project in one place— all code snippets, notes, images, or prototypes associated with a project are kept in a single place so your team can easily access them.
----
Be viewed multiple ways to surface important information— slice a roadmap many different ways to show only what you want to see, like which projects an engineer is assigned, or all the bug fixes scheduled to ship this week.
How does this help your team?
Ship fast, ship quality, save time— speed is a competitive advantage, so you need a system that'll allow you to maintain speed (and your quality bar) instead of worrying about the logistics of project management.
Extend your team's capabilities— creating a scalable process allows your team to work on more projects with broader impact. And with a customizable roadmap, you can match the workflow to your specific team's needs.
----
Transparency, both on your team and company-wide— a shared roadmap gives your engineers visibility into what everyone is working on, and the entire company can see the status of projects that relate to their work.
Your roadmapping and project management system is a way to see large-scale projects and all the small tasks and materials associated with those projects. Here's how you can create it, with recommendations for engineers to get the most out of it.
In Notion, you can make a few different types of databases: tables, lists, boards, calendars, etc. Here, we'll be using a board — a collection of individual project pages that you can move from one stage of the process to the next.
----
Hit/to show the full menu of options for what you can do in a Notion page. This is called the "slash command."
To make a board, type/boardand selectBoard - Full pagefrom the menu. This will create a new page that's just your board.
You'll see we've started you off with some columns. You can customize these to match your team's workflow. Click on each to change the title, and go to the right and hit+ Add a groupto create a new column.
You'll also see we've started you off with a few blank pages. These will be your projects. Click one, and you'll see properties associated with it at the top.
Grab one of the cards and move it along the process. See how good that feels?
----
This board acts as both your roadmap and project management system.You can have everything related to a project within each page, while also tracking its progress. This helps save engineers time bouncing between apps that simply point you to the work — Notion keeps it all in one place.
Before helping you organize your projects, we wanted to touch on a system that's been super beneficial for our engineering team.
We organize our projects in epics, tasks, sprints, and bugs.
⛰️ Epics are large, overarching initiatives.
🔨 Tasks are actions that make up epics.
🏃 Sprints are time-specific pushes to complete a set of tasks.
🐞 Bugs are specific types of tasks to fix things.
----
These will become tags that connect everything your engineering team is working on. For example, if an epic is improving mobile startup time, in that page, you can see all the tasks associated with it, like rebuilding the share sheet on iOS and Android.This keeps everything related to a specific project in one place so you don't miss anything.More on this below.
But first, here's some tips for how to set up your project management and roadmapping system.
----
Add properties to your pages— inside your board's pages, you'll see properties. These are attributes you assign to each page, like the date it was created, the PM, or the type of project. Click on a property and selectProperty Typeto see options for properties. Use aSelectproperty and name it "Type" to create tags for "Epic," "Sprint," "Tasks" and "Bugs." Use aPersonproperty to tag the engineers on the project. Use aDateproperty to select the ship date. Use aMulti-selectproperty to tag different sprints these tasks will fall into.
----
Show properties in the board view— this will help you get a bird's eye view of everything in your board from metadata. Near the top right of your board, selectProperties. This will bring up all the properties you've put in your cards. Toggle each one you want to display in the board view. You can even grab the⋮⋮icon to re-order how they're shown on the cards.
----
Change the grouping of your board— on the upper right of your board, you'll see aGroup bybutton. With it, you can change the columns on your board to any of theSelect,Multi-select, orPersonproperties you've added to cards. For example, you can group by engineers to see who is working on what. You can group by sprint to see the tasks in each sprint. You can group by priority to see what project you should tackle next.
----
Add views —with Notion, you have the ability to display one set of information in many different ways. Maybe you want a calendar of when epics will ship or a table of all the bugs your team is working on. To do this, hit the+ Add a viewnext to the title of your table, select the type of database you want, and hitCreate. You can then apply different filters and sorts to customize further. Let's say you want a table of your highest-priority bugs. Create a table view, then selectFilterand then+ Add a filter. You can now choose the type property as bug, and only bugs will show up in the table. To sort, selectSortthen+ Add a sort, then select the priority and make is ascending.
----
Notion makes it easy to customize how you see your entire collection of projects.Whether it's information for a certain project or a calendar of your largest initiatives, Notion puts the power in your hands. This unlocks both granular and high-level tracking of your projects where you can get a complete download of everything at a glance.

Using aRelationproperty, you can show every task related to a project in that project's card.
----
Let's say you're adding in-line emojis to your product. You'd create an epic for that project. Then, you'd create a number of tasks needed to complete that project — like emoji autocomplete and emoji tooltips. Inside the card for the in-line emoji epic, you'll see every task, so your team can stay organized and efficient.
Here's how to set it up.
Create an epic— this should be a big project you're working on, like "In-line emojis."
----
Create an epicRelationproperty— in that card, select+ Add a propertyand chooseRelation(don't forget to name it "Epic"). A list of all your databases will appear. Search for the database you're currently in. After selecting it, you'll be given two options for the type of relation you want to create. ChooseCreate a new property. This makes your relation sync both ways, so that you can assign a task to an epic, or assign an epic to a task.
Create a taskRelationproperty— following the same steps above, create another relation property, connect it to the same database and call it "Tasks."
----
Connect a task to an epic— now you're ready to create a task. Using our example above, create a card for "Emoji tooltips." Using the "Epic" property, select your "In-line emojis" epic.
Open the card to see all the tasks— in your "In-like emojis" epic card, you should see all the tasks that have been assigned to it. You can add as many tasks as necessary to get the job done.
Relation properties unite all your work. So if you have a big, complicated project that requires many tasks and engineers responsible for them, you'll be able to collect and organize them all in a single place for greater efficiency.
----
You now have the framework for your project management and roadmapping system. Each one of the pages in this board will also house all the elements of each epic, task or bug.
Instead of bouncing between software, your engineers can work, give feedback and connect all their tools in one place using Notion.
----
Customize every page— different projects require different documentation, each arranged so they're easy to navigate. Notion gives you just enough structure so that you can organize information however best fits the task at hand. Create headers inside of pages by typing/heading. Then, make columns by grabbing the⋮⋮icon and dragging and header all the way to the right. Using the⋮⋮icon, drag-and-drop text, images, videos and more under those headers for a neat and tidy page that's easy to digest.
----
Embeds just for engineers— engineers use a unique set of tools to get their work done. Notion brings all of them together. Type/codeto include a code snippet right in your page, like when you're launching new mobile and tablet controls and want to see if the code looks right to your team. Or you can share a GitHub gist by typing/gist. You can even include an/imageor/videoto show those new controls in action right in the page.
Watch our 3-minute video that teaches you everything you need to know about code blocks here 👇
----
Pages inside pages— You can keep all documentation related to a project neatly inside it. Just add them as sub-pages with/page. Add infinite layers of pages to capture all the information you need to complete anything, and give yourself and your team clear pathways to find everything in your sidebar by opening the toggles.
Feedback in real time— use the@symbol to mention one of your teammates to get feedback on a project. A fellow engineer can make some notes in your code. A designer can provide comments on a Figma file you've embedded of the new dropdown menu. Normally, designers and engineers would be siloed in their own tools. Instead, Notion connects cross-functional teams for tight feedback loops.
----
Decisions made with full context— inside pages, you can have a running thought process for every aspect of a project. Include notes about why a task got de-prioritized or why your team changed the code guidelines on mobile. You can even include test results inside these pages to put some data muscle behind your decision-making framework. Notion gives you full clarity of what happened and what needs to happen next.
When project work and project management happen in the same place, you don't need to worry about anything slipping between the cracks — you have one system, so no cracks exist.
Everything you need to know about comments and discussions in 4 minutes.
----
In your project management system, you can create templates unique to each problem an engineer will tackle.
Templates help engineers approach problems the same way every time. This leads to a consistent problem-solving approach that saves time and builds strong institutional knowledge.For example, in a bug report, you'll have headings prompting your engineers to get screenshots and replicate the bug — this helps surface what information you'll need to find an answer faster.
To add a template to your board, click the down arrow next to the blueNewbutton on the right side of your database and select+ New template. A blank page pops us where you can create the template once and use it over and over again.
----
Here are a few ideas for templates your engineering team can use
Click to expand
When asked about our engineering team's project management and roadmapping system, engineer Sarah Lim says, "A good task management system adapts to a team's knowledge and processes."
She continues, "Relations allow us to associate heterogeneous entities. A set of tasks can be related to a project, which in turn relates to meeting notes and design documents. The result is a system that captures what's happening and how all of the constituent pieces fit together."
Here are a few tips we've learned for managing our engineering project management system:
----
Create a linked version of your database for engineering sub-teams— if you have sub-teams, it's a great idea to create a database view that's only their tasks and projects. Inside yourengineering wiki, each team can have their own page, like one for your infrastructure and platform teams. At the top of the page can be a version of the project management and roadmap system that's filtered just to show the infrastructure team's epics. This helps encourage focus without losing transparency for what the eng team at large is working on.
----
Link your meeting notes to your project management system— just like tasks are linked to epics, you can also link allmeeting notesto your epics. Create anotherRelationproperty and link it to a meeting notes database. That way, you can have every discussion about a project cataloged along with its tasks. This type of asynchronous communication helps foster transparency and keep everyone in the loop, even engineers who weren't in the room during the meeting.
----
Assign a clear owner for every epic and task— make twoPersonproperties in your epics and tasks, one for the project owner and another for the team responsible for executing it. By having a clear owner, anyone who has a question about the project knows who to ask. This makes for clear, streamlined, cross-functional communication.

Three key databases for teams, and how to use them
Databases are powerful, digital filing cabinets where you can organize pages and add layers of information to each item. Instead of your documents getting lost in hidden folders, databases give everyone visibility into what’s happening across the company. You have the flexibility to view your information in different ways and create context-specific filters and views.
And, if you need a doc or a task to show up somewhere else, there’s no need to copy and paste plain text. You can resurface information dynamically across the workspace, wherever it’s relevant.
----
Want to view all your team’s tasks for the week grouped by the assignee, standardize and speed up documentation, or design a project dashboard uniting all relevant meetings, documents, and tasks?
You can do all this and more with three databases that are essential for every team: Meeting Notes, Docs, and Tasks & Projects
We’ve created templates for all three of these databases, which are linked below. You can copy them straight into your workspace and they’ll be ready to use with your team. This will be rolling out to all users in the coming weeks. If you don’t yet see it in your workspace, you will soon!

Check out our in-app template pickerhere.
----
If you’re using Notion for knowledge management, you might be keeping everything from last week’s all-hands meeting notes to the product team’s latest project scope and quarterly OKRs somewhere in your workspace.
We show you how to create an easy-to-navigate company wiki, with top-level pages and sub-pages living within themhere. But, you’ll also need databases if you want to avoid a cluttered workspace, where team members have to dive into pages within pages to find what they’re looking for.
Let’s take a closer look at how you could use Meeting Notes, Docs, and Tasks & Projects databases in your company workspace.
----
If everyone who attends a meeting jots down their own disconnected notes, there’s no guarantee you’ll leave with clear takeaways. Plus, it’s not easy to refer back to what was said.
A meeting notes database will help your team become more methodical about note-taking. Meetings stay on track, and everyone knows the next steps.
Here are some things you can do with your meeting notes database:
Use properties to categorize meetings— Add a meeting date, and use aPersonproperty to tag all attendees. With aSelectproperty, add meeting type tags to indicate whether it’s a standup, weekly sync, etc.
Choose a list layout sorted by date— SelectSort, byDate, andDescendingto view the most recent meetings first.
----
Group or filter according to meeting type— If you want to review notes from the design team’s recent meetings, you can group the database by meeting type or attendees. You can then save those filtered views to come back to in future.
Take meeting notes inside the database entry— When a new meeting takes place, simply create a new item in the database, fill in relevant properties and start taking notes.
Use templates to speed up note-taking and improve accuracy— Set up a template for each different kind of recurring meeting. Inside the template, have key properties already filled out where possible. Add some page content like bullet points, a checklist and some useful headings so you can jump straight into note-taking as the meeting begins.
----
Clear documentation results in greater transparency and gives everyone accountability for their work. Your docs database can become the single source of truth for company information. You can have one docs database for the whole company, and then create synced views within each department’s teamspace.
Here are some tips for using your docs database:
Add dimensions of information to each document— Documents in your docs database are much more than just pages stored in folders. With properties, you can add more context compared to a regular document, from dynamic properties like created date and last edited date, to select properties to label documents and status property to tag docs as In Progress, Complete, etc.
----
Create templates for often-used documents— Fill out properties and add an outline of page content so you never have to draw up a technical spec, architecture overview, or project scope from scratch.
Format documents aesthetically— Inside the page, you can organize text into columns, headers, bullets, checklists, images, embeds, and more. It’s up to you to design your documents however makes the most sense. You can even embed databases within the page, or sync content from other tools like GitHub and Jira.
Task and project management is a breeze if you use a database to track all your team’s to-dos.
Tasks & Projects are two related databases that work together to help you connect the dots between daily jobs to do and larger objectives.
----
Here’s how you can manage your tasks and projects in Notion:
Add new tasks as separate entries into the database— Make sure to enter all tasks into your database to ensure nothing ever slips through the cracks.
Tag each task with properties— Status property, assigned, and due dates can help you see what tasks need to be done, and by who.
Select a project for each task— Projects are made up of a series of tasks. Create a separate database for tasks, and use a relation property to connect them. That way, you can attach tasks to relevant projects, and you can see how close your projects are to completion.
----
Group tasks by project, assignee, or due date— Easily see all tasks by their corresponding project or due date. Grouping tasks by assignee is a great way to see what each of your team members has on their plate.
Use a progress bar to show project completion— You can add a satisfying progress bar to show how close you are to completing your projects. First, add a  rollup property to your projects database. When you edit the relation, choose “Tasks”, and select the status property. Then, select “Calculate percent per group” and choose “complete.”  Now, whenever you move tasks into “completed” you’ll see your progress bar move closer to 100%.
----
View ongoing projects on a timeline— See how different project commitments cross over by creating a timeline view of projects. Make sure your projects have a start and end date so you can visualize their duration.
When it comes to customizing your databases, the possibilities are endless.
Here are some database basics to help you get databases up and running in your workspace.
To add a new page to a database click+ Newat the bottom or theNewbutton at the top right. This creates a new, fully customizable page that lives inside the database. You can tag this page with intelligent properties according to the structure of the database.
You can also create page templates inside the database to help you speed up and standardize your work.
----
To create a template, just clickNew template. Anything you add to this page will be saved as a template that you can recreate automatically in the future. Include any information that you want to appear every time, whether it’s properties you want to fill out or page content like headers, bullet lists, or prompts. You can create various templates for each database so you don’t always have to create pages from scratch.
----
Properties allow you to categorize database entries in just about any way you can imagine. Basic properties allow you to add text, numbers, custom tags, person tags, dates, and more. With advanced properties you can relate one database to another, pull through specific information from another database, and even build custom formulas.
Full a full list of database properties and learn more about themhere.
To customize a database layout, go to the options menu (…) and selectLayout. Here you can choose between table, list, board, calendar, or timeline layouts.
----
Tables give you an overview of all your documents— Tables are the default database layout and they’re great for large sets of information, or when you want to see everything in a database.
Lists are a simplified way to view items— For an uncluttered view of your recent meeting notes, you could use a list database.
Board view can help keep track of your team’s tasks— Kanban board databases are ideal for project or task management. You can group the board database by the status property, so you easily move cards across from In Progress to Done for example.
----
View launch or publish deadlines on a calendar— Calendar layouts are useful when you want to see database entries plotted by date. You can use a calendar to see when content goes live or when new features are due for release.
Timelines let you visualize your workload and deadlines— If you’re managing a team, timelines can be a helpful way to look at projects because you can see how much you have on your plate at any one time.
You don’t have to decide on just one layout per database. One database can contain multiple views. To add a new view, click+next to the current view, and you can add a different layout. you can then switch between different database views using the tabs at the top of your database.

----
To learn more about database views and how they can be used, check out thisvideo guide.
As your database grows, you need a way to view information that’s relevant to different situations. By using filters, you can display subsets of information based on properties. So, if you want to view documents related to a certain project, or notes from all of last week’s meetings, you can use filters to show these entries, and hide everything that’s not relevant.
To quickly filter your database, clickFilterand choose the property you want to filter by. Here are some examples of ways you might filter databases:
----
View all meetings that took place in the last week— Use a date filter to view all meetings that took place during the last week, tasks due this week, or content to be published in the next month.
See all tasks in progress— Filter by status to only show tasks that are currently tagged “In Progress”.
Filter to see one type of document— Use a filter to show only certain types of documents.
View tasks assigned to you— Filter by person to see all tasks assigned to you, or meetings you attended.
Focus on high-priority tasks— Display only projects or tasks that you’ve marked as priority.
If you want to apply more than one filter, you can also selectAdd advanced filter. From here you can add as many filters as you need.
----
So, you could filter your tasks database to show all tasks that due this week, assigned to you, and ready to start.
You can group together items based on properties, so you could separate items in the database by status, assignee, due date, document type, and more.
In a board view, grouping changes how the cards are arranged on the board. When you group a table, you’ll see that the database splits into sub-tables according to groups.
Another way to organize information in a database is through sorting. You can sort entries in a database to put them in order of date created, due date, or sort alphabetically according to titles or tags.
----
Now, to combine the power of filters and views, you can create multiple views in a single database, each filtered to show a different set of information.
Then, you can tab across your database to view different information depending on what you need to see.  For example, within one database you can have:
An overall view of everything in the database— This could be a table database filtered to show all tasks not marked “Done”.
A kanban board grouped by status— You can easily drag tasks across from “In Progress” to “Done” in a board view layout.
A weekly view of everything due this week— A list view filtered by date can show everything you need to get done this week.
----
A personal view of items assigned to you— Focus on your own to-do list by filtering to show only items assigned to you.
To create another view of a database anywhere in the workspace, hit “/” and choose “Linked view of database”. Instead of creating a view from scratch, you can choose an existing data source to import.
Linked database views allow you to bring relevant information across into different areas of the workspace without duplicating your work. You can create contextual views of a database with custom filters and views applied.
You can even bring source data from various databases to display as different views in the same database block. This allows you to create dashboards to view relevant information side by side.
----
To create a project dashboard, you could create one database block which unites all the tasks, documents, and meeting notes related to that project, which would appear as different views in the same database.

Take these three steps before onboarding your team to Notion
When teams try to shoehorn their processes into rigid tools, something usually breaks — information is lost, time is wasted, work is incorrect or repetitive. When a tool is flexible, it enables customization to the needs of specific teams, helping them work and collaborate more efficiently.
We see this all the time in how different teams within a company use Notion, whether that’s an engineering roadmap or a marketing content calendar. Each workspace is unique and entirely molded to the needs of that team.
----
But before they start building on Notion, the most successful teams take a moment to consider what Notion can do for them. This helps you build better systems and workflows that match the vision you have in your head.
Because Notion is so versatile, it’s important to internally define how you want to use it — and align on what you want to accomplish with Notion.
Define your goal of using Notion— whether Notion is new to your org or you’re looking to expand, it’s important to understand why you’re using the tool. Maybe teammates don’t have clarity into company goals, so you’re bringing on Notion to create better internal alignment. This sets you up for the next point.
----
Discuss what you want to build with it— after goal-setting, think about the system that will help you accomplish those goals. This doesn’t have to be specific to Notion’s features yet. It can simply be something like, “creating a hub where all employees can see company’s goals by quarter.” Knowing what you want will help you better get there.
----
Think about how your teammates will use it— Notion gets more powerful through collaboration. Understanding how different teams / individuals will plug in gives you a better idea of what to build and what you can accomplish. Will it be just your team using Notion? How many people? Will it be a cross-functional hub? Think about Notion’s role not only in your organization as a whole, but also the people using it.

----
Your company is likely using many different tools to get work done. The average companyuses 88 of them. Knowing what tools you have, what they do, and which teams use them can help you understand where Notion will fit in.
As you’re considering your tech stack and Notion’s place in it, here are a few things to think about:
Notion works best as a central hub for your tool ecosystem— your reliable and up-to-the-minute source of truth. Use it to organize your company knowledge, connect content with context, and provide a dedicated space for each team to think, plan, and create while staying connected.
----
Notion can enhance many existing tools— for example, you might use Slack to call attention to an important project you built on Notion, and then integrate a Loom video at the top of your project brief to share quick context and summary.
Notion can be the connective tissue between disparate tools—Notion’s APIandembedsallow you to bring information that lives in different tools together in Notion. This helps teams collaborate because they all come to one place for information about a project, instead of needing to grant access or learn how to navigate many tools.
Here’s how you can think aboutwhere Notion fits into your tool ecosystem.
----
There’s a lot you can do in Notion, but you can also unlock a ton of functionality with just a few basics. By giving your teams a couple of core skills, you’ll be able to help them understand how to get the most out of the tool.
Notion is built on blocks. Everything is a block! Text, headers, bullets, images, video. You can move them around the page too, using drag and drop.
Remind teammates that there’s no correct way to do things. The best way to use Notion is to explore the power of its flexibility and experiment with what’s possible.
Go step-by-step through a common use case.Here’s all our templates. Pick one, and show them how you might move cards through a Kanban board,like this project management system.

Timeline view unlocks high-output planning for your team
Deadline-driven teams can use timeline view to plot their tasks and projects chronologically — giving you one place to see scope and deadlines, while maintaining the ability to adjust them when things (inevitably) come up along the way.
----
Timeline is another database view you can use to visualize the same information in many ways. It builds on the classic Gantt chart, only with far more flexibility and customization. As one example, you might have one database containing all your engineering projects, with a timeline view showing how long they’ll take to build and when they’ll launch. And all those project pages in the timeline can be structured however you want or based on the project’s needs.
Rigidproject management softwaredoesn't afford real-life flexibility. It's difficult to change things, and when you do, it's a job in itself for project managers to communicate these changes and foresee all the cascading consequences.
Timeline view fixes this by giving your team:
----
Flexibility to view projects and adjust them as needed— whether a project takes a month or a task takes two hours, you can see everything happening in one place. And when you need to shift course? Easily re-scope or move the entire thing.
Full understanding of concurrent tasks and prioritization— parallel work streams help your team maintain shipping cadence. Like a Gantt chart, timeline view shows you the overlapping nature of your projects or tasks, allowing you to prioritize P0 work.
Customizable views based on schedules or project elements— get as granular or as high-level as necessary. See tasks by the week or the entire month, all with the relevant information you need.
----
And if you'd like to see them an entirely different way, switch to table, board, list, or calendar view. You can always slice and dice your projects however is most helpful to you. Project managers may love timeline view’s Gantt capabilities, while designers want to see their work on a board.
Pages in your timeline are a blank canvas for any project— every page in your timeline can be fully customized to store all the information related to that project, like images, video, to-do lists, and documentation.
Since timeline view is a type ofdatabase view, some elements will likely be familiar. Just like other database views, you can:
----
View properties in your timeline by hitting•••, selectingProperties, and using the eye icon to indicate what you want to see. You can show all, hide all, and add or delete properties in this same menu.
Filter and sort based on your needs, like to see only projects you're working on this week.
However, some elements of timeline view will have that new car smell. Even for frequent users of Gantt charts, you'll have more features with timeline view. Here's how to use them:
Every page needs a date— to be seen on a timeline, pages need aDateproperty. Pages added to a database with timeline view will automatically contain a defaultDateproperty you won't be able to delete.
----
Using end dates & times— to scope an extended project, in yourDateproperty, add anEnd date. You can even toggle onInclude timewithin a date to get more granular.
Drag-and-drop to move projects or extend them— move all the pages on your timeline however's necessary, whether that's pushing a task until tomorrow, or dragging one side of a project page to give yourself an extra week to complete it. You can even shift projects up or down if you want to re-prioritize.
----
Combining a table with your timeline— when you create your timeline layout, you can toggle onShow table. This puts a table on the left side of your timeline view, where you can see certain attributes of your pages based on the properties you select. You can change this at any time in your “view options” menu underLayoutorProperties. Maybe in your table you’d have the engineering sub-team working on the project and the project owner. Then in your timeline, you’d have the dates of the project scoped out.
----
Choose how you want to see the calendar— instead of the fixed timeline of a typical Gantt chart, you might need different timelines on which to view your work (like tasks for the day or big projects over the course of a month). To the left of< Today >, you'll see where you can change the view of your timeline. Hours, days, weeks, quarters, years. You choose.
Organize your timeline by any date you need— in the•••menu, underLayout, you can selectTimeline byto see the availableDateproperties by which to organize your timeline. You might have one view with anEnd datefor two-week sprints, or another that's only launch dates.
----
Timeline puts the dates of a project or a task front-and-center, so everyone knows what to be working on when, and your whole team can drive toward shipping on time.
See how Notion users are leveraging timeline view, complete with templates you can duplicate and start using right in your team's own workspace. On any of these pages, just hitDuplicatein the top right corner and choose the workspace to add them to.

Tips to keep your team’s Notion pages up to date
As your team grows, Notion grows with you. Your processes, your team, your company — scaling often means creating more content to support that growth, whether it's an onboarding deck or outlining new processes.
That documentation is the foundation on which you'll scale. But keeping it up to date and organized is just as important.
Using features in Notion, you can streamline your ability to keep track of what pages need revisions, ensure information stays fresh, and communicate updates to the rest of your team.
Seeing the progression of a page from its creation to the latest version gives your team transparency — and helps you understand what needs an update.
----
Here are a few ways you can keep informed when you have engineering sprints, marketing projects in progress, and other pages that constantly change.
On the top right of your Notion page, you'll see a tab forUpdates. Here's where you can see all the changes made to that page.
If it's a page where you need to be updated of any edits made to it, toggle onFollow this page.  A checkmark will appear next toUpdates, which means you'll receive notifications in your sidebar (underAll Updates) and via email.
----
Let's say you're checking a page's updates and notice something was incorrectly changed — like your engineering team's QA process. Instead of going through each of the individual line changes in theUpdatestab, you can just restore an old version of that page.
Tap•••at the top right of any page and selectPage history. A menu will appear where you can see what that page looked like on a certain date. If those updates to the QA process were incorrect, select the right version and clickRestore Version.
You can view and restore past versions of any Notion page up to 30 days back if you're on a Personal Pro or Team Plan (and indefinitely on an Enterprise Plan).

----
If your team keeps documents, tasks, or meeting notes in a database, certain properties in your database can help you see when pages were created, by who, and when they were last edited. This gives you a quick look into recent changes. Click+ Add a propertyto see your options.
Under Advanced, you’ll see thesedatabase properties:
Created time— this automatically timestamps the page's creation. If the page is foundational, it might not need action. But if it’s something like a project spec or meeting notes from months ago, it could be a candidate for a cleanup.
----
Created by— automatically record the original author of any database page. If you’re going through and organizing any docs or meeting notes, you canmentioncreators of pages to confirm if those pages are needed any longer.
Last updated by— see who made the latest changes on any given page automatically. This can show you who’s frequently adjusting pages. Like theCreated byproperty,Last updated byhelps when it comes time to clean up the pages in a database because you can see who’s updating pages most.
Last edited time— another way to see which pages in your database are freshest, theLast edited timetimestamps the page's last edit.
----
You can get a high-level look at any of these properties while viewing your database. After you add any property, clickPropertiesabove your database and toggle them on.
Have a large database and want to quickly see which pages haven’t been updated recently? Select atable viewof your database. ClickSortabove the table. Select+Add a sortand choose yourLast edited timeproperty from the dropdown menu and selectDescending. This brings the most frequently edited pages right to the top of your database so you can quickly assess which pages your team might need most.
----
You may want to clean up some out-dated pages in your workspace, but might not want to delete them into the digital ether. That's why we suggest creating an archive for every top-level page in your workspace.
This allows you to keep a tidy page but also have some of those old pages for reference — like a product charter that your team might want to reference when building something similar.
Simply create the archive as a sub-page, and drag out-dated sup-pages into it.
Whether it's a team wiki or your company's benefits, you probably have pages in your workspace that are frequently used but only need updating every few months. Here's how to keep those pages fresh so your team is getting the right information.
----
Save yourself the time of restoring old page versions after accidental changes. Let’s say you change your team’s stock option policy. You wouldn’t want a new employee accidentally editing it as they’re reviewing that page.
Click•••and selectLock page. When youlock a page, nothing can be edited or changed by anyone (including you!) until the lock is turned off.
For full-page databases, you can use theDatabase lock. Anyone will be able to edit the pages in the database. But they can't change views, properties, or values ofSelectandMulti-selectproperties.
You can remove the lock on a page or database anytime by hitting•••and clickingUnlock page.
----
You can also restrict who can edit specific pages bycreating permission groups and updating the share settings.
Instead of doing this in the page's comments, we find it better to make aCalloutat the top of the page — so it's clear who owns that page.
Type/calloutat the top of your page and type@and their name to mention them in the callout. That way, they know they're responsible for that page. But maybe even more importantly, anyone who has questions about the page's content knows who to ask.
You can also set expectations of how often page owners need to revise pages by adding reminders. Add a deadline for completing updates with@followed by the date. For example, typing in@6/30creates a timestamp that displays Jun 30, 2021.
----
Maybe you want someone to go in and check the team wiki again three months from now for updates to benefits policies or the company mission statement. First@mention them in a page comment on the page you want them to revisit. Then add@remindand enter the deadline for the next round of updates. Click into that@tag with the date and a calendar window opens up. Here you can set it so that they receive a reminder two days before the due date.
After setting a reminder, whoever you tag will receive a notification underAll Updatesat the top of their left sidebar. They can also update theirnotification settingsto receive these reminders via email or push notifications.
----
Sometimes page updates aren’t as obvious as they need to be. You may want to call out your team’s updated Roadmap when a feature release gets pushed to later in the quarter or a subtle change in positioning happens. Notion makes it easy to share the news.
Give your team a heads up by pushing updates to Slack. ClickUpdates, located top right for any page or database. Switch onConnect Slack channel. You'll see a prompt to sign into Slack or if you're already logged in, you'll need to give permission to Slack to integrate with Notion.
----
Then choose the Slack channel where you want to push Notion update notifications from the dropdown menu. Automatic alerts will now happen whenever an edit or comment occurs for that page or database (or any sub-pages within it).
You can integrate Slack on any Notion pages and select the most relevant channel so updates reach the right people on your team. For example, your team may have a Slack channel dedicated to Notion updates around your Roadmap features. This helps keep everyone in the loop on what’s underway and when feature release dates change.

Two note taking systems to make your engineering team more transparent & productive
High-output engineering teams make good documentation a habit. They take detailed notes in meetings so that every decision has context. They attack problems methodically in writing. They solicit feedback asynchronously to get to the best solutions.
The problem with documentation is that — in the absence of a system — it can be a lot. A lot scattered across multiple tools, folders, repositories, emails, and uncategorized Google Docs. What's lost can't be learned from. It can't make your team stronger.
----
That's why we're sharing these two tools.Our team uses them, as do dozens of others, to give notes structure, make them easy to find, and — most importantly — make them useful.
Build a Meeting Notes database to give everyone time-saving, morale-boosting visibility
Build  Docs to make all your specs, proposals, research, etc. collaborative and searchable
Customize both to your team's needs and workflows
Here's how your notes and docs could look:
What earns someone the coveted title of "10x engineer"? They ship with speed and quality. Not just sometimes — consistently. This requires repeatable systems for higher order thought.
Good notes help you go faster 🏎
They're easy to find so you don't waste time hunting for information.
----
They're structured so you can extract value with a quick skim.
They give you a record of what's been tried and what works — so you don't duplicate effort.
Good notes make your work better ⭐️
They capture your ideas so nothing gets forgotten.
They give you a place to think deeply about problems, implications, edge cases.
You can share to get clear feedback from the right people.
When note-taking is foundational to your engineering culture, you 10x your team's productivity. In a world where the fastest team that delights users wins, this is nontrivial.
Meeting notes make every standup, sync, and session impactful for your entire team when they follow these rules:
----
Good meeting notes are comprehensive and action oriented.They make it possible to go back and consult any conversation. And they surface to-do's that propel your team forward.
They're organized so anyone can reference them.New employees, teammates out sick, or people from marketing or support can understand them and why they matter.
They're open and central so no one is left in the dark.Engineers don't distract each other with questions that already have answers, and there are no politics around who knows what.
Ok, so they're helpful. But how do you build a good home for them?
Here are best practices for setting up your meeting notes:
----
Create a list database —Add a new page in your sidebar and chooseListfrom the menu. It's the most minimalist database view for easy focus. Every page inside it can be a meeting.
Add properties —For every set of notes, you can assign properties that show attributes like when the meeting took place, who was there, and what type of meeting it was.
ClickPropertiesat the top right of your list, then+ Add a property.
----
Choose the property type and give it a name, likeParticipantsfor aPersonproperty to tag who was there, orDatefor aCreated timeproperty that adds a time stamp, orTypefor aSelectproperty to tag standup, weekly sync, sprint planning, post mortem, etc. You could even have aSelectproperty calledTeamif you wanted to tag meetings by engineering sub-team — like mobile, desktop, internal tools, etc.
Create and customize as many properties as you want.Learn about all property types.
Hide/show properties —Only view the properties you want to see in your list. Maybe you only want to see date and time created. ClickPropertiesagain and switch on the ones you want.
----
Notion makes it possible to view the same database many ways — as a table, Kanban board, calendar, filtered by properties, etc. You can add multiple versions of your information in one place and switch between them instantly. No need to re-create content or re-apply filters.
Click+ Add a Viewat the top left of your meeting notes list.
Choose the type of view you want to add. For example, chooseBoardto see your notes grouped by meeting type or by sub-team.
----
Or chooseListagain and apply a filter. Let's say you want a list of only weekly syncs. Create a new list view, then hitFilterat the top right and set the Type property to Weekly Sync. Now you can toggle between all meetings and just syncs. Do the same thing to filter out meeting notes from before a certain date (a nice way to archive old docs).
In this 4-minute video, we cover everything you need to know about database filters.
A note-taking system is only as good as the notes it contains. The highest utility notes have clear sections with headings, record who said what, break out a checklist of action items, and provide enough context so anyone can understand what took place without asking.
----
In Notion, you can use database templates to generate the right format for every type of meeting:
To add a template, click the down arrow to the right of the blueNewbutton at the top right.
Choose+ New Templateand add the structure you want in the page that comes up — whatever headers or properties you want when you create a new meeting next time.
Next time you add a meeting, click that same dropdown and choose the template you want.
For engineering team meetings, here are some suggested templates:
Daily Standups
Add all the usual participants in that property field — they'll appear there automatically
Add the Standup tag in the Type property
In the body of the page, add fourH2headings:
What did we do yesterday?
What are we doing today?
----
Potential blockers?
Action items (with a checkbox underneath)
Sprint Planning
Add the Sprint Planning tag in the Type property
Sample headings:
Sprint Goal — What you want the sprint to accomplish
Sprint Backlog — Items you're committed to working on during the sprint
Teams & Roles — Scope of responsibility for each person
Notes — For the content of the meeting you capture
Consider adding one line of text under each explaining what the section is for in gray
To assign responsibility use@to mention the name of the owner
Post Mortem
Add the Post Mortem tag in the Type property
Sample headings:
User facing impact — How did this incident affect users and how many?
Timeline — How did the project or issue unfold and who responded?
----
Relevant metrics - Paste in graphs, links to Slack threads, etc.
Notes — Actual discussion during the meeting
Cause analysis — Dig deep into why the incident happened.
Resolution — How was the incident resolved? What did we do well in response? What can we do better next time?
Future work — How do we prevent this incident in the future? If a short-term fix was implemented, what is the long-term fix?
Consider adding a table of contents with/tocat the top. These notes can get quite long and this lets you jump to the part you need.
Add text under each heading to explain what that section is for so more people can use this system on their own.
----
Each of these setups is designed to push your team to think deeply, communicate regularly, stay aligned around goals, and help each other improve — as engineers and as a group.
There's a second type of note taking we'll cover here. We'll call these as Docs — writing that codifies policies, proposes changes, specs out features, reviews tool options, sets rules for the codebase, provides guidance, and more.
Examples include:
Better error reporting — A proposal for a new process
Full stack engineer onsite interview — A rundown of questions to ask candidates
Testing for infrastructure team — A description of the testing framework
Architecture brainstorm — Evaluating all options to scale a feature
----
Engineering manager transitions — A doc about how promotions work
Just like an office is a physical environment that defines your work, these docs provide a digital environment that does the same. Reading through these can teach any newcomer how you operate, what's important to you, decisions you've made and why.
Now, here's how to build this open book for engineers past, present and future.
Just like you did for meeting notes above add a new list database to your workspace.
Your properties should be different. Use them to capture more metadata that will be helpful about each doc. We suggest:
----
Type —Selectproperty labeling the document as a certain type, i.e. Technical Spec, Project Kickoff, Architecture Overview, Request for Comment (a.k.a. RFC - more on this soon), Planning, Reporting, Research, Data Analysis, etc.
Status —Selectproperty indicating whether further action is needed on the doc. Tag options could be In Progress, In Review, Implemented, Open for Comments, or Archived
Created time —So you know when the doc originated
Last edited time —So you can see when it was last changed or updated (gives you a good sense of what's still important or stale)
Created by —Records the creator so you know the point person
Last updated by —So it's easy to track down who worked on the doc last
----
Reviewers —So the creator can tag stakeholders whose eyes they want on the doc
Priority —Selectproperty to give everyone the sense of urgency (or lack thereof)
You don't have to show all these properties in your list. Hide the ones that aren't important to understand at a glance.
With all this context, every doc is easy to find and understand immediately.
Use the search field at the top right of your database to jump to the information you need.
Shared documentation can make your team's output better. And it's even more powerful when you share a Docs database with your whole company — you'll get a variety of opinions that could open new perspectives.
Get more feedback more efficiently with an RFC practice
Click to expand
----
There are a few database views that are especially helpful for engineering Docs:
By Type —Create a Board view grouped into columns by Type so you can see how many docs are in each category. Easily access all team policies, all specs, etc.
By Status —Board view so everyone can see where docs are in your process. Maybe something's been stuck in backlog forever, or you need one more round of feedback.
By Creator —See all the docs created by individuals across your team. Let's say you're coming up on annual reviews, you can get an instant sense of people's contributions.
Only my Docs —Create a new list view and filter it by the Creator property. Choose yourself to see only the docs that you created in one convenient spot.
----
Only Engineering —If your Docs database is open to your entire cross-functional org, you can add a filtered view that only shows docs created by and for engineering.
Customize your Docs views in ways that are helpful for completing a task and understanding information quickly.
Just like database templates can help you cover your bases during different types of meetings, they can enforce quality and comprehensiveness of thought in your Docs.
For instance, as you spec out a new product feature — it's tempting to jot down rough ideas and start building. The right template can force you to pause, carefully articulate the problem you're trying to solve, identify the metrics you want to move, support your hypotheses, and work through edge cases.
----
This is how you get to consistent quality of execution across a growing technical organization.
Here are some template recommendations for engineers:
RFC
Add RFC to the Type property
Sample headings
Problems — List all the problems that could be solved by this feature.
Research — Aggregate qualitative research from user studies and quantitative research from your dashboard tool.
Solution — Describe what you want to build and add images (or embed Figma files) of prototypes.
Process — Walk through the design thinking process that led to the solution.
Consider adding gray text underneath each heading with instructions for that section so people who are new the system can easily use it.
----
Whenever Docs are used to make decisions, it's always critical to capture the rationale for the choice made so that future reviewers can understand it, and new employees can pick up philosophies that shape how the team runs.
Technical Spec
Add Technical Spec to the Type property
Sample headings:
Summary — 1-2 sentences about the doc and its purpose
Background — What is the motivation for these changes? What problems will this solve? Include graphs, metrics, etc. if relevant.
Goals — What are the outcomes that will result from these changes? How to measure?
Add anH3heading for Non-goals - What won't this proposal accomplish?
Proposed solution — Describe the solution to the problems outlined above.
----
Follow-up tasks — What needs to be done next for this proposal.
Add threeH3headings under Proposed Solution:
Risks — Highlight risks so reviewers can direct their attention here.
Milestones — Break down the solution into key tasks and estimated deadlines.
Open questions — Ask any unresolved questions about the proposed solution here.
Consider adding a table of contents at the top to jump to the right section fast.
Project Kickoff
Add Project Kickoff to the Type property
Add the following sections withH2andH3headings:
Overview — What is the project? Why are we working on this?
Problem statement
Proposed solutions
----
Success criteria — 1-3 sentences on what success for the project looks like. Include metrics and qualitative descriptors if relevant.
User stories — What will the user be able to do after the solution is shipped?
Scope — Define what will be done and what will not be done as part of this project.
Requirements
Non-requirements
Architecture Overview
Add Architecture Overview to the Type property
And create the following sections with headings:
Description — Describe the software component. What does it do?
Diagram — Include a visual if it's helpful.
Client — Describe relevant codepaths in the client codebase.
Server — Describe relevant codepaths in the server codebase.
Database — Describe relevant tables and views in the database.
----
We designed database templates to make it fast and simple to create content over and over again. But the real value is actually shaping your process. As you scale your team, nothing can give you more leverage than making it second nature for everyone to make good decisions on their own.
Not specific to engineering, but this video can give you a basis to make your own systems.
Just 9 minutes of watching for a future of good note taking.
Now that you have these databases up and running. There are a few things you can do to make them more powerful.
----
One of the benefits of managing everything in Notion is that you can create homes for every team inside your organization. Engineering can have its own page organized exactly the way they want —here's how to build that kind of wiki.
Put your engineering team's meeting notes and docs a click away from the rest of your work by nesting them inside the same page.
If you also have your engineering projects in Notion, you can create a relation between any one project and all the meeting notes about it, or all related docs.
In your meeting notes database, add a new property, chooseRelationfrom the type menu and call itProject. Choose your projects database in the menu that pops up.
----
For every set of notes, click on that property field to add the project you discussed.
Now, when you open a project page, you'll see all the meeting notes neatly organized and accessible. It's a two-way, automatic sync.
Bringing any new system onto your team takes time. But once routines are built, they'll have an outsized impact on how you all think and work together. Here are some ideas to ease the way:
Hover over the top of your database and clickAdd Description. Create quick instructions for using any system for all to see.
Create database views relevant to your teammates in advance of sharing with them so they can see the value for their own work.
----
For example, you might create views for mobile or infrastructure sub-teams to see only notes from their meetings.
Demo the convenience of database templates. Whenever you start a new meeting, share your screen with the group, apply an instant template, and take notes in real time.
When your team sees how these tools eliminate busywork and help them focus, they'll come aboard and you can start reaping the compounding benefits of healthy documentation.

The ultimate guide to AI-powered knowledge hubs in Notion
Employees often struggle to find the information they need, leading to inefficiencies in your work and theirs — and costing your business in big ways.
We dreamed up with our customers of a better way to create and find your knowledge, and it's called an AI knowledge hub. These hubs can help you empower employees to find and understand information they need to do their jobs.
Whether you’re onboarding new employees, creating single source of truth for your engineering documentation, supporting a customer experience team at scale, or looking for a low-lift way to deflect internal IT tickets, a knowledge hub with AI Q&A will help you do it.
----
In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to build, roll out, and maintain your knowledge hub.
While you might be eager to dive into your knowledge hub build-out (as are we), it’s important to start with a plan. A successful AI implementation includes a clear strategic goal, identifyingwhowill use your knowledge hub,whatinformation they will find, andwhyyou’re investing in building one at all.
Consider the following tasks before you embark on building your knowledge hub in Notion:
Identify who will use your hub —Determine the primary users of your knowledge hub. This could include employees, departments, or specific teams that will rely on the hub for information.
----
Determine key stakeholders —Identify the people who will have a significant influence on the development and success of your knowledge hub. This is likely a group of folks including a Notion champion, a knowledge manager, an IT admin, and other folks that make sense within the context of your org (like bizops, or a chief of staff where relevant).
Assess current state and gather user feedback —Collect input from potential users to understand their needs and expectations for the knowledge hub. Learn where your audience is finding (or not finding) answers to their questions, and determine how long it’s currently taking them to do so. Your goal throughout this project will be to reduce that time spent searching.
----
Find your documentation and create a content map for future state —Next, dive into your docs. What questions can be answered with current documentation? Do you need to write new docs? Update old ones? Write this all down, you’ll come back to it later on.
Set a measurable ROI goal —At this point, we hope you have a sense of the pain points in your current workflows. That means it’s time to set a tangible goal for your upcoming project! Notion AI can help teams save significant time from searching for information and increase their overall productivity and satisfaction at work. Use theNotion AI ROIcalculator to set a goal for your team.
----
The rest of this guide will walk you through the steps your team needs to take to transition from your current state to your new knowledge hub in Notion. Happy building!
We’re here to help!
Reach out to our sales team for support to start building your strategy with an experienced partner.
Your team does its best work when everyone on it has access to the information they need to do their jobs, when they need it. Just like the entrance to your physical office sets the stage for a productive working day, your knowledge hub home-base sets (appropriately) high expectations for what your users will find in Notion.
----
Begin by setting up a dedicatedteamspacefor your knowledge hub. This space will serve as the central location where all knowledge hub templates and resources are stored. Make sure it is easily accessible to all team members who will be contributing to or using the hub, either by making it a “default” teamspace (so members are added automatically), or by setting the permissions to open such that anyone can join.
Once your teamspace is setup, you can begin building the architecture for your hub. For now, focus just on how users will navigate the hub. At a minimum, your knowledge hub template will include the following components.
Skip this step with templates for every team
We created best-in-class templates for your knowledge:
----
Engineering hub
Onboarding hub
Customer support hub
IT trouble shooting hub, or
Legal and compliance hub
To use these templates, duplicate them into your workspace, and move each page into the sidebar of your newly created teamspace. Then, read on for guidance on filling your hub with content and rolling it out to your team.
Top level page —you’ll want to utilize a single, top-level page to act as a landing place for your knowledge hub. This is a place for your team to get a birds-eye-view of the information in your hub, and an understanding of how they can use it. It’s also a great place tomentionpages that you want to draw attention to, or request feedback (more on that later).
----
Wiki database (part of your top level page) —once your top-level page is established, you can use the “Turn to Wiki” button in the...menu on the top left of your Notion page to create a new view for organizing sub-pages. Adding pages into a database will help immensely as you organize and scale your knowledge hub thanks to properties like tags and verification. Learn more about wiki databaseshere →
FAQs —the FAQ database serves two important purposes as you build out your knowledge hub. First, it creates a repository for key bits of information that are otherwise buried in long documents. Second, it helps AI more easily find the answers to commonly asked questions, ensuring your team gets what they need as quickly as possible.
----
AI Q&A —make sure you see the AI icon in the bottom right hand corner of your app (if not, check to make sure you have AI enabled in “settings”). This is where you and your end users will go to ask questions about the content in the knowledge hub.
Use-case specific trackers —These are tailored to meet the specific needs of different teams within your organization — like a product feedback tracker, or IT request system. They help in gaining insight into workflows, tracking progress, and ensuring that everyone has access to the necessary information.

Knowledge management in a modern workspace goes beyond just the documentation inside your wiki. Your employees need to find answers to more dynamic questions too — like the status of their IT ticket, whether someone else has recently left feedback on a specific product area, and so much more. A knowledge base that doubles as a tracker for your day-to-day work makes this dream a reality.
Consider the following examples. Each of these leverage Notion’s flexible structure to organize information in a way that is both accessible and actionable, enabling teams to collaborate more effectively.

Once you’ve set up the architecture of your knowledge hub, you’re ready to start adding your team’s content. This will likely be the longest step in your process, but will pay dividends when it’s time to roll your hub out to your end users. Remember that a knowledge hub is only as valuable as the quality of knowledge housed within it.
----
Remember how we told you to write down the docs you want to have in your knowledge hub? Time to grab that content map once again (or finish it if you haven’t yet). Once you have a high-level understanding of all the documents and FAQs that you want to add to your hub, you’ll start the heavy lifting. There are three main ways to bring content into your hub:
Importcontent from other apps— Bring in existing content from tools like Google Docs, Confluence, Asana, or even PDFs. Centralize your team’s information and make it easily accessible within Notion by placing these pages into your Wiki.
----
UseMove toto gather content from your Notion workspace —Consolidate all relevant Notion pages into your knowledge hub by using theMove tofunction and moving them into your new wiki database. This helps to keep your workspace organized and ensure that all necessary information is in one place.
Create new content, and use AI to help —AI can help you start from scratch to create a draft in seconds so all you have to do is add the extra information your team needs. Like uploaded files, video recordings, or even slide decks. Plus, If you’re working through half-baked docs, or translating very technical language, try using Notion AI to expand and organize your thoughts into comprehensive, well-structured content.
Integrate with other tools

AI connectors extend the reach of your self-serve knowledge hub, allowing your end-users to access the most up-to-date answers to their questions, even if they haven’t been documented (yet). Learn more about AI connectors here.
You’re almost ready to share your knowledge hub with the world! Before you do, dot your metaphorical “i”s and cross your metaphorical “t”s by making sure your information is well categorized and organized. Here are a few things we recommend:
Clean up your page icons —you’d be surprised how far a couple of intentionally picked page icons can go when it comes to rolling out a nicely packaged knowledge hub. When in doubt, pick a color palette and give every page an icon of that color.
----
Add a welcoming callout —on your top-level page, add a quick callout explaining what users are looking at, and how they’ll interact with it, and who to contact with questions. This helps to reduce the mental overhead required to engage with a new tool.
Tag pages in your wiki —Use relevant tags to categorize your pages. This helps in searching and filtering information quickly.
It’s the moment you’ve been waiting for! Rolling out your knowledge hub to your team is a huge accomplishment, but it isn’t the end of the road. In order to ensure your end users get value out of your knowledge hub, you’ll need to invest time into training them on how to use it, and continuously reinforce it’s existence.
----
Before you jump into training your team, make sure the right people have the right access to maintain and update your knowledge hub effectively. You’ll manage permissions in the teamspace settings menu, and should deal with users in two primary groups:
Add teamspace owners —Teamspace owners act as the primary knowledge curators. They are responsible for the overall organization, structure, and maintenance of the knowledge hub.You’ll want to give them Full Access so that they can create, edit, and delete all pages within the teamspace.As teamspace owners, they’ll also be able to adjust teamspace settings, invite/remove members, and manage permissions.
----
Then, add teamspace Members —Teamspace members contribute to the knowledge base by adding new information, updating existing content, and actively engaging with the AI-powered features. They are also the primary consumers of the knowledge.Give them “Can edit” permissions to edit existing pages and create new pages within the teamspace.
Teamspaces are Notion’s solution to complex permission requirements
Click to expand
Now that everyone has access to your knowledge hub, it’s time to announce your hub and train your team. You’ll know what announcement channels tend to work best for your company (and we have some tips below, too!), but dont forget to teach your audience how to use your new tool.
----
To start, make sure your end users have the resources they need to navigate your knowledge hub. In your announcement comms, focus on helping users learn how tonavigate using the sidebar, and how toget answers about work content faster with Q&A.
Start emphasizing the value of Notion AI, even demo-ing some questions that users can find the answers to within your new and improved knowledge hub.
Give your team the resources they need
Click to expand
If a resource is created, and no one knows about it, does it even exist? Internal comms are a vital component of your rollout strategy, and you should expect to spend a few weeks (up to a few months) showing off your new hub. Here’s just a few ideas that have helped our customers:
----
Start with a pilot group —for a bigger roll out, consider starting with a pilot. A diverse pilot group across departments can help test the knowledge hub and gather feedback on usability, content, and AI effectiveness before a larger launch.
Preview your hub in a team meeting or all hands —schedule a dedicated session to walk through the knowledge hub, highlight key features, and demonstrate how to use it effectively. This ensures everyone is familiar with the new resource.
Send written communications about your hub —draft an email or internal memo that outlines the purpose of the knowledge hub, provides usage instructions, and includes a link to access it. This helps to reinforce the hub's importance and utility.
----
Stop answering questions —this is the hardest, and most important component of a successful knowledge hub rollout. In order to build new habits, you’ll want to continuously re-direct your question-asking colleagues to your new and improved knowledge hub. Gently remind them to ask their question to Notion AI before asking in your slack channel or DMs.
Think of your wiki as a garden. Just as a garden needs regular tending to flourish, your knowledge hub requires continuous updates and care. Plant new ideas, prune outdated information, and nurture the content to keep it vibrant and useful for everyone who visits.
----
One of the worst detractors to the long-term health of your knowledge hub is stale or outdated content. That’s why it’s important to set up systems to keep your content fresh.
We recommend starting with the following:
Add verified properties —verified properties ensure that the information in your knowledge hub is accurate and trustworthy. Implement a process where subject matter experts review and approve content on a regular cadence. They’ll get notifications when their content is about to expire.
Create an “admin” view —an admin view allows administrators to oversee and manage the content more efficiently. This view can include filters and sorting options to quickly identify outdated or inaccurate information.
----
Keep content in a single database —Centralizing your content in one database prevents information sprawl and makes it easier to maintain. This structure helps in keeping the knowledge hub organized and ensures that users can find information quickly. Learn more about how Notion AI finds answershere.
Utilize AI autofill —AI can summarize or extract information from all of your wiki entries at once based on a single prompt. This can help to save time by generating answers based on text in a page, without you having to read through each one manually.
Add an upvote button —Encourage users to interact with content by giving it an upvote. This helps prioritize valuable information. Learn more about database buttonshere.
----
Create a feedback database —Set up a database to collect and manage user feedback about the knowledge hub itself to assist with continuous improvement.
Usepage analytics—these can help you see which what content is getting the most use and prioritize updates accordingly.
Schedule regular content reviews —set up a recurring schedule to review and update the information in your knowledge hub. This ensures that the content remains relevant and accurate over time.
----
Building and maintaining an AI-powered knowledge hub in Notion is an ongoing process that requires careful planning, organization, and continuous improvement. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can create a valuable resource that not only helps your team access the information they need but also leverages the power of AI to keep your documentation up-to-date and easily searchable. Remember, the key to a successful knowledge hub is engagement and feedback from your users, so make sure to encourage interaction and continuously refine your content based on their needs.

Understanding how Q&A finds answers can help you get better results
With Notion’s Q&A tool, you can ask questions about workspace content and get a natural language response. Q&A goes beyond a simple search, and uses AI to surface relevant pages and produce a clear answer to your question.
Notion users have been wondering exactly how Q&A finds and sorts information to give the most accurate answers.
In this guide, we’ll explain how Q&A provides answers and also give you some of our tips and best practices for getting the most helpful results from Q&A.
----
Q&A is part of Notion’s AI package. It’s a built-in chat tool that surfaces and synthesizes information. Ask any question, and it will provide an answer based on the contents of your workspace. and allows you to ask naturally worded questions about the information in your workspace.
To start a conversation, click the sparkle at the bottom right of any page, type your question, and click⬆️send.
Results will appear in seconds and may include links to pages along with a written response.
Chatting to Q&A is almost like conversing with a colleague, and you can go back and forth, asking follow-up questions until you get the information you need.
----
Instead of interrupting a colleague and waiting for their response, ask Q&A to surface information about a topic, explain a company process, help you catch up on a missed meeting, analyze the results of a campaign, and more.

Notion AI gives you three distinct AI tools in your workspace
Click to expand
To use Q&A to it’s full potential, it helps to understand how it works so you can ask the right questions.
Here’s a breakdown of how it works:
When you write your question into the Q&A chat box, the AI will formulate a search query and question. Though keywords can be helpful, Q&A looks at the overall meaning of your question rather than just specific words.
----
Q&A finds a large number of pages that match your request by looking at page titles, content, and document paths.
From this collection of pages, Q&A will narrow down to a handful of pages that most closely match your question. Q&A tries to provide high authority answers, so it favors pages that have been recently updated and viewed often.
Remember that Q&A:
Doesn’t search through databases(yet)— Since databases are just collections of pages, Q&A may not understand that multiple pages belong to the same database. A request like “Count the number of tasks completed by Valerie this week” may not be answerable. However, you could ask Q&A to surface some of those tasks.
----
Can't reach into private pages you don’t have access to— When you ask a question, Q&A will only look at the pages you have access to throughout the workspace to retrieve an answer.
Doesn’t have access to wider knowledge— Unlike the AI Writer, Q&A can’t access general knowledge. If you ask about topics that aren’t explicitly covered in your workspace, Q&A won’t return a result.
Q&A can be an extremely helpful time-saving tool to glean insights from the knowledge contained in your workspace.
In order to get the best results possible, you’ll need to follow some best practices in both workspace maintenance and question formatting.
Here are some of our recommendations to make Q&A a powerful tool for all members of your team.
----
Avoid leaving pages untitled, and instead, give each page a meaningful title that represents its content.
You should also nest pages in the relevant teamspaces and wikis according to the topic or department they relate to. Build a company wiki for general information and separate wikis for each department or team.
Q&A takes the creation date, last edited date, and total number of visits into account when producing results, so popular pages that have been created or edited recently are more likely to appear.
Making sure important pages are reviewed and refreshed as often as possible can help Q&A prioritize the best and most relevant content.
----
If you don’t want to delete old content, you might file it away in an “Archive” page. However, Q&A can still discover these outdated pages.
While an archival strategy is the best approach to removing outdated content. You can help colleagues by simply adding a word like “outdated” or “deprecated” to expired content page titles.
You can embed PDFs, website pages, and other kinds of external content directly into Notion pages. However, Q&A can’t read the text contained in those embeds.
Make sure any important information is also copied over as a text block to make it findable by Q&A.
Be as specific as possible in your requests to get the most accurate results.
For example:
----
Ask, “What happened at the design standuptoday?” instead of “What happened at the design standup?”
Ask, “What's our process for onboarding a new contractor?” instead of “What's the onboarding process?
Using time-specific phrases like “from the last 7 days”, “this month” or “in 2022” can help narrow down search results and help Q&A provide the exact information you’re looking for.
Wherever possible, look for ways to add more specificity and give plenty of context to all your requests.

Understanding Notion’s sharing settings
Sharing pages is table stakes for working with your team in Notion — it enables communication and cross-functional teamwork.
But there are different ways to share pages depending on what you or your team needs. You can share pages with individuals. You can share pages with teams or entire companies. You can even share pages with the external agencies that help you work. And understanding these nuances is foundational to collaboration.
Here, we'll explain the different ways to share Notion pages, so you can easily grant the right level of access to those who need it, from workspace members to guests.
There are four types of people that live inside a Notion workspace:
----
Workspace owners — these are usually the people who oversee the workspace, like adding members,creating permission groups, and configuring the advanced security settings.
Membership admins (Enterprise plans only) — these are leaders who can add members and edit permission groups, but can’t change workspace settings.
Members — the rest of your team will be members of the workspace. They can create Notion pages, share and edit them, but they can’t change the workspace settings or add new members (here's more info on
members).
----
Guests — these will likely be people outside your organization that you want to collaborate with, such as clients or third-party vendors. You can invite them to view and edit pages, but they won’t have access to the whole workspace.
TheSettings & membersmenu in the sidebar is where you’ll go to manage permissions.
Here, under theMemberstab, workspace owners can add new members to the workspace by clickingAdd members, then either searching for their name, entering their email address, or copying and sending them the Invite link. When you’ve added someone, you can use the toggle next to their name to decide which membership type to give them.
If you'd like to learn more aboutmembership types, we got you covered.
----
One of the easiest ways to start working with your team in Notion is to enable those with a work email to join your workspace automatically.
InSettings & members, go toSettingsand scroll down to theAllowed email domainssection. Here, you can type one or more email domains (@yourcompany.com, for example) that you want to grant access to automatically.
Whenever someone signs into Notion with an email with one of those domains, they’ll have the option to join your workspace. If you go to theDomainsection, you can create a custom URL for the workspace. You can share this with anyone who has an allowed email domain, and they’ll be able to join the workspace immediately.
Creating groups within your workspace for easier sharing
Click to expand
----
Sharing pages can be situational. You might want to quickly send a product spec to a designer for review. Or you could ask for company-wide feedback on a new process doc. You may even need to put a link into a Notion page in an email.
Whatever the case, knowing how to share these pages will help ensure the right people see the right page. Open the Share menu to view (and edit!) who has access to the page, and what level of access they have.
There are different ways to share content with workspace members.
----
Share with your whole company —you’ll want to share some pages with everyone at your company, even if they can only view or comment. You can do this from your sidebar by dragging the page into the General teamspace, which includes everyone at your company.
Share with a member of your workspace—select or type their name into the Add people, groups, or emails box and click Invite to share the page with a member of your workspace. This is great for quick collaboration, or for 1:1s between manager and direct report.
----
Share pages with your team —Teamspaces make it easy to create a shared space with your team, where you’ll keep all content relevant to your work. Each department in your organization can have its own teamspace, and you’ll also have a “General” teamspace for company-wide information.
Share the page with a guest— in theAdd peoplebox, type the email address of the person you’d like to share the page with. These are likely the external partners you're working with, where all you need is their input on a single page (or small collection of pages).
----
Publish the page to the web— if you want anyone to be able to view the page, you can publish it to the web by navigating to the Publish tab and clicking Publish to web. You can make the page visible to search engines by turning on Search engine indexing. This is beneficial if you want to use Notion to extend your website, like publishing a help center or FAQs for customers to access. Here’sa walkthroughof publishing pages to the web.
Send via a link—you can quickly share a page internally or externally by copying and sending the page link. You can easily drop the link into a Slack conversation or email.
----
As well as sharing pages, you can change permissions for people or groups, whether they are members or guests of the workspace. This ensures that, when sharing pages, those with access to pages have the right level of access.
In the sharing menu, click the dropdown next to a name or a group. You’ll see that you can choose between 4 options —Full access, which allows full editing rights plus the ability to share the page,Can edit,Can comment, orCan view.
You can clickRemoveto remove someone’s access to the page, and it will no longer be visible to them.
----
When you publish a page to the web, you can click theShow link optionsdropdown and set whether people can comment, view or edit the page. Like the example we shared above, you probably wouldn't want anyone on the web editing your company's FAQ page.
If you’re an workspace owner of anEnterpriseaccount, you can restrict how content is shared. InSettings & Members, in the Security tab, you’ll find some options that you can toggle on and off which allow you to prevent members from sharing pages publicly, adding guests, moving pages to other workspaces, or exporting content.
Keep this in mind when sharing pages with sub-pages
Click to expand
----
We've seen companies share information different ways, depending on who needs to see or edit that information. Here are some common examples of ways your team can use Notion's sharing settings for better collaboration:
Your benefits information or mission statement— for documents that everyone in your company needs to see, you can useShare with everyone at [your company]. You can give certain team members, such as HR managersFull access, and make the pageCan viewfor everyone else.
----
A design draft or project spec— when you need the whole design or engineering team to view or collaborate on something, you can use permission groups to share with everyone at once. This is useful when two teams, like engineering and product, need to work together. Set up permission groups for each team, then you can share the page with the whole team at once.
----
A document that you’re working on with one or two others— when you need to share something with just one other person, such as a 1:1 database between a manager and team member, you can share the pages with that person individually. You can create the database in the private section of yoursidebar, so no one else has access to it. Then, share it with individuals by typing their names intoAdd people.
Requesting feedback from a client— agencies who work with external clients might need to share mock-ups or proposals and ask clients for feedback on those pages. Invite them to the page as a guest by typing in their email address, and grant them permission to comment.
----
Your company’s FAQs or help center— anything you want to share with the world, such as your FAQs or help center, can be published to the web. Toggle onShare to the weband toggle different options depending on whether you want people to be able to edit, comment, or duplicate the page.

Unearth fresh insights from your personal knowledge library using Q&A
Notion is your personal knowledge bank, where you keep notes, documents, ideas, and scraps of inspiration. As your library of knowledge grows, you need a way to surface information so you can extract value from it.
After all, taking notes is great, but without an easy way to reference key knowledge and build on the ideas, you might end up with a vast library of idle information.
With Notion Q&A, you can ask questions about anything in your workspace, and get a succinct answer that summarizes all relevant content across the workspace, and makes sense of the knowledge you’ve gathered.
----
In this guide, we’ll demonstrate how to use Notion Q&A to unearth insights, discover patterns in your web of knowledge, and synthesize multiple resources into new takeaways.
A productivity system for business, studies, or personal growth must allow you to do several things - capture ideas and resources, keep them organized and easy to find, and extract value from your information.
In Notion, you capture information using a notes database or web clipper. Then, database properties, sorts, and filters allow you to organize content. With these tools you can quickly build a large repertoire of knowledge, and Q&A is the final piece of the puzzle that allows you to unearth helpful information when you need it.
----
While many productivity systems encourage you to continuously prune your archives to remove irrelevant content, with Q&A you don’t need to do this. Instead, keep everything, and use Q&A to filter through your best ideas and build new connections.
Instead of relying on your brain to remember what you’ve read and archived, you can ask Q&A any question about the content in your workspace. Then, it will find the relevant pages, summarize their contents and provide a pithy answer to your query.
Anytime you have a question about the information in your workspace, just click the purple sparkle in the bottom right of your screen to bring up Q&A.
Type out your question, and Q&A will provide an answer based on the content in your workspace.
----
You can ask Q&A to:
Explain the difference between a plant an animal cell— Q&A will review all resources you’ve saved on this topic and summarize the difference.
Find evidence that screen time can reduce a child’s attention span— Q&A will collect sources you’ve saved that support your argument.
Show me information about a client— If you want to review docs related to a new client you’ve just onboarded, Q&A can surface the relevant material.
You can ask Q&A any kind of question and it will search your entire workspace for the answer.
Q&A only has access to your knowledge
Click to expand
----
As a student, you absorb knowledge from all directions - books, lectures, research papers, and more. With such a vast amount of data to process, the real challenge comes when you have to convert everything you’ve consumed into original thought.
Q&A can be a powerful study assistant to help you clarify your ideas and build upon your research. It can also help you manage the responsibilities of student life!
For example, use Q&A to:
Find out a deadline or upcoming exam dates— Q&A can review your study calendar and check your upcoming deadlines or exams. Then, you can ask it to help you create a study plan.
----
Extract key takeaways about a topic— If you have several pages of notes on a topic, as well as various resources saved from the web, you can ask for the most relevant insights or learnings on that topic. Q&A will then synthesize all the relevant pages into a neat takeaway to help you get started on your next paper.
Discover conflicting research or arguments— To make sure you’ve covered all angles you could ask Q&A to compile conflicting information about a topic that you’ve uncovered in the course of your research.
Ask specific questions about your research— You can ask Q&A questions about your class notes, for example, if you want to find out what year a book was published and who wrote it.
----
Your AI assistant can quickly locate all the resources you need to kick of your next paper, and help you stay in control of your time.
Entrepreneurs and solo-preneurs must juggle many responsibilities. In your small business, you might be handling everything from cold outreach to content marketing and accounting, not to mention actually delivering work for your clients.
As your business grows, you need to establish processes and consistency. With all your knowledge in Notion, Q&A can help you get quick answers and learn from your previous results.
Try asking Q&A to:
----
Bring up docs onboarding docs I sent to my client— Q&A can find relevant docs you’ve sent to a client during the onboarding phase, such as your contracting agreement and scope of work.
Get an overview of your client profiles— If you’re working on defining your Ideal Customer Profile, ask Q&A to summarize your client profiles. Then you’ll be able to identify commonalities across your client base.
Identify 3 prospects I haven’t contacted in the last month— To make progress with your sales strategy, you can ask Q&A to find leads in your CRM that you need to reach out to.
Show me results of client campaign— To surface some of your most impressive achievements, you can ask Q&A to bring up results from a successful client campaign.
----
If you’re building a personal brand and trying to grow your presence online, you’ve probably collected a wealth of inspiration from other creators you admire.
With Q&A as your assistant, you can turn all those snippets from podcasts, blog posts, books, and social media posts into new and original ideas.
You can use Q&A as a way to evaluate the knowledge you gather and produce fresh insights and helpful curations for your audience.
Create a content strategy by asking Q&A to:
Find me 3 productivity tips specifically for students— Q&A can review all the resources you’ve collected on productivity and filter through only the ones that relate to students.
----
Show me my notes about the “Pomodoro technique”— Read through all the research or notes that mention a specific topic in order to write something new.
Explain the key differences between the “PARA” and “GTD” systems— Q&A can scan through all the material you have on these topics, and then give a summary of the key differences, or pros and cons.
Find contrasting approaches to building a habit— To present some conflicting ideas in your content, you can ask Q&A to find contradictory approaches then use this as the basis for a post.
----
With questions like these, you can synthesize all the information you’ve gathered from difference sources to answer questions that your audience cares about. Instead of simply paraphrasing another resource, you’ll add your own spin to the ideas by drawing from various sources.
Then, use AI Writer to start drafting a content strategy and outlining articles or posts.
Notion’s AI package consists of three tools which each serve a different function.
So what’s the difference between Writer, Autofill, and Q&A?
Put simply:
Writer helps you draft, edit, and improve your writing —You can use it to generate new content, research topics, and refine your ideas. It can access external knowledge.
----
Q&A retrieves and synthesizes information from one or more documents contained in your workspace— Using natural language, Q&A answers questions based data from your workspace, but doesn’t have access to external data.
Autofill automatically extracts key information from database pages— Autofill is a database property that provides an overview of database contents and continually updates as items are added and changed.
All three tools help you work more efficiently and enhance your productivity and creativity.

Unleashing productivity with Notion's Slack integration
Teams rely on both Notion and Slack to get work done, but information often gets lost in the shuffle. Slack conversations can be hard to track, to-dos might be missed, and the important knowledge in Notion can feel disconnected. Jumping back and forth between tools can lead to distractions and make it difficult to focus on what's important.
Integrating Slack with Notion cuts out the constant back-and-forth between apps, allowing you to stay laser-focused. The result? Your productivity skyrockets.
In this guide, you’ll learn how to:
Connect Slack with Notion in just a few clicks
Set up custom Slack notifications that sync with your Notion databases
----
File tasks and feedback from Slack conversations directly into your Notion databases
Enhance information sharing with rich link previews
Use Notion’s AI connector to synthesize and extract key takeaways from your Slack conversations
Slack is great for real-time chats, allowing teams to share ideas on the fly. Notion, on the other hand, excels at storing and organizing those ideas, making them easy to track later. However, switching between Slack and Notion to manage tasks can be tedious. Imagine if these tools could work in lockstep, unleashing the power of your team’s collective memory no matter where you work.
By integrating Slack with Notion, teams can :
----
Get Slack notifications for new requests— Lots of teams run on request systems — your content, design, or social media teams can receive Slack notifications whenever a new request is added to their database.
Capture customer feedback— Your Customer Success team can automatically add important feedback from customer Slack channels to their Notion database so its visible to anyone in your workspace at a later date.
Log bugs in Notion from Slack feedback—Engineering teams can easily log bugs reported by colleagues directly from their Slack channels into their Notion database.
----
Include user messages in Notion documents— UX teams can use link previews to add user feedback and opinions from Slack into project documents, giving more context to their ideas.
Use AI to save time with instant answers and context— AI can help you easily find information from both Notion and Slack. You can ask questions and get answers that combine information from both places. This makes it simple to find what you need, no matter where it's stored.
This connected workspace keeps task tracking in perfect harmony, letting you concentrate on your most important work without missing a beat.
----
You can connect Slack to Notion in just a few clicks. You'll encounter several opportunities to set it up as you work across both tools. For example, when you paste a Notion link into Slack, you'll see a prompt toConnect Notion. If you're new to this integration, we recommend starting with ourintegration gallery →. This gallery shows you all the ways to connect Slack with Notion.
Integrating Slack with Notion
For step-by-step instructions on integrating Slack with Notion, view ourHelp Center article.
When you integrate Slack with Notion, you can set up two types of notifications:
Privately, to yourself— Set up alerts to notify you whenever you're mentioned anywhere in Notion.
----
To a public Slack channel— Usedatabase automationsto send alerts to specific Slack channels whenever there are updates to a Notion database.
These automatic alerts help you stay on top of your projects. They make sure you don't miss any important updates or requests.
A teammate might tag you in different parts of a page, like in the content, a comment, or the person property in a database. This tagging usually occurs when you're given a task or project. You can customize notifications to alert you whenever you get tagged. A slack message will show informing you of the context in which you were mentioned.
Here's how to set it up:
In Notion's side panel, navigate toSettings & Members, then selectMy Notifications & Settings.
----
Select the Slack workspace name in the text and drop-down menu.
You can turn these notifications on or off at any time using the drop-down menu.
Reply to Notion Comments from Slack
Pro Tip: You can also respond to Notion comments directly from Slack. Just click reply, type your response, and send. Your reply will appear as a normal comment in Notion.
Keeping track of changes in a Notion database can be difficult, especially with frequent updates. For example, you might want to know when the status of a task in your project database gets updated. Slack notifications can provide timely alerts to a specific channel whenever important updates occur in your Notion project database.
----
Imagine you want a notification whenever a task is marked 'complete' in your projectdatabase.Toset this up:
Open your database and click the•••at the top of a database →
Automations. Alternatively, you can select⚡at the top of a database.
ClickAdd trigger. A drop-down menu will appear with options. Choose your desired property—in this case, you might want to selectStatusfrom the property list.
For properties with multiple options (like the one you picked), choose which changes you want to be notified about. In this case, select only 'complete' and uncheck all other choices. Then clickDone.
Under the 'Do this' section, clickAdd action, chooseSlack notifications, and give your notification a name.
----
Select the Slack channel where you want to send your notifications.
When you're satisfied with your settings, clickcreate.
Voilà! From now on, whenever a task is marked as ‘complete’, Notion will automatically send a notification to your chosen Slack channel. With a myriad of customization options, you can fine-tune Notion's Slack notifications to fit your needs.
Add Multiple Triggers to Your Database Automation
Pro Tip: You can add as many triggers as you want to your notification. To add a new trigger, click on the plus sign and pick whatever extra change you want to keep track of.
----
Often, important tasks, decisions, or bugs come up during a chat with teammates on Slack. Instead of stepping away from your conversation to log them in a database, you can save these items in Notion directly through Slack. You can also add details like priority or assignee at the same time.
For instance, employees might send product feedback to your Engineering Slack channel. The Product team can then collect these issues and add them directly to their database for tracking bugs.
To get started, follow these steps:
ClickMore Actionson the Slack message you want to save to a database and select
Create task in Notion.
----
2. Select your database by entering its name, pasting the Notion database link, or choosing it from your frequently used databases list.
3. Provide a title for your database entry.
4. ClickAdd Propertyto set any relevant properties for your entry.
5. Once done, clickSave. Slack will inform you in the channel that the new database item has been created.
Your new task is now visible in your Notion database. To view your new database page, click on the entry's name.
No matter where you're working, it helps to have as much context as possible. Link previews across both Notion and Slack make the sharing experience seamless.
----
When you share a Notion page link in Slack, it will automatically unfurl to show the page's title and creator. This preview helps everyone quickly understand the content of the page, even if they don't have access. This nice sneak peek means your colleagues won't need to wonder about the context behind a link. They'll get a preview of the page and be able to see how relevant it is to them at a glance.
Quick Access Sharing from Slack
----
Pro Tip: When you share a Notion page link in Slack, some people might not have access. A pop-up will appear, asking if you want to give them access. You can do this right from Slack, so you don't have to go back to Notion to change sharing settings. This also makes sure your teammates don't have to ask for access separately.
Every Notion page shows a link preview back to the Slack thread, so you can always see the original message for context. This smooth integration helps you understand Notion documents right from Slack, getting rid of the need for manual summaries.
----
Important insights often emerge unexpectedly in Slack conversations. You can easily preserve that knowledge by pasting those messages into Notion. The messages will appear as a link preview, allowing you to easily embed them into project briefs, user research documents, or your company wiki.
This makes it easier to find information without searching through Slack. It also helps readers quickly access the original message. This way, they can easily contact the person who first shared the information if they need to.
To copy a Slack message :
Click the three-dot menu on the relevant message, namedMore Actions.
SelectCopy Linkfrom the drop-down menu.
Navigate to the desired location in Notion and paste the link as a mention, preview or link.
----
Notion AI connectorsmake it easy to find information from both Notion and Slack in one place. If you can’t remember where a piece of information lived, just ask Notion AI, and it will pull the relevant information from both Notion and Slack.
You must be a Notion workspace owner and Slack workspace admin (or approved Slack member) to connect Slack to Notion AI.
Click to expand
Here are some ways Notion AI can help you get useful information from your Slack chats:
Turn brainstorming sessions into action plans:Notion AI could take a freewheeling Slack brainstorm and pull out concrete action steps or project ideas. Just ask AI to "extract action items” from the specific channel.
----
Keep track of project tasks:By bringing Slack into the fold, Notion AI can use your conversations to locate tasks, remember decisions, and more. This helps you stay on top of projects—without leaving your workspace.
3.Consolidate team feedback:A product designer might use Notion AI to collect all the feedback on a new feature scattered across multiple Slack channels into one organized Notion document.
4.Find answers easily, even if you don't know where to look:Notion AI helps you find the most relevant information quickly. For example, when a new colleague messages you on Slack, just ask Notion AI who they are. It will give you the full scoop, making it easy to connect and collaborate.

Use Asana link previews to keep your teams on the same page
Your team just started using Notion to manage marketing projects, but what about the email campaign that’s mid-way through, or the help center revamp project you’re about to wrap up? Maybe you’ve been tracking all that work on another tool like Asana. Or maybe a department you collaborate with, like design, have just renewed their Asana subscription and aren’t ready to migrate to Notion just yet.
----
Luckily, you can use start using Notion today in combination with other tools to organize, manage and track all your work. Link previews allow you to paste content from other tools into your Notion pages, so everyone with access to the page can view the content even if they don’t have a subscription to that tool.
This means you can include everything your marketing team needs in a project page, from Asana tasks, to Dropbox files, and even your Miro boards. This makes collaboration a breeze and keeps everyone on track, regardless of what tools they use.
We’ll show you how link previews can help consolidate everyone’s work into a single source of truth for project and knowledge management.
----
You can create a link preview of an Asana task or project on any Notion page.
To do this, go to the task or project in Asana, and click on theCopy linkicon. Paste the link into Notion, and selectPaste as preview.
You’ll then be prompted to connect to Asana, if you haven’t already. ClickConnect to Asana to updateand follow the link to grant permission.
Now, your task will appear as a link preview, and you’ll be able to see key information such as due date, assignee, and last updated time.
You can follow the same process for creating link previews of content from other tools.
You can use a page in your projects database to compile all relevant information about your project.
A project page might include:
----
An outline of the project scope and brief— Write out your goals for the project, reasoning, and how you aim to get the work done
Filtered view of tasks database— You can create a linked view of your Tasks database and filter it to show tasks related to the project.
Links to relevant resources and files— You can paste links to useful resources, research and reference information
Previews of Asana tasks, Dropbox files and more— Using link previews, paste in tasks to do or project pages from Asana, or files from Dropbox for everyone to see.
Projects & task management in Notion
Our Projects & tasks templates are purpose-built for project management and include custom properties and relations. Discover how to use themhere.
----
If your cross-functional collaborators keep all project tracking information in Asana, your team risks being out of the loop. But, instead of logging in to yet another tool to see what’s going on, you can import all the information in Asana straight into a Notion database using a synced database.
What’s helpful about synced databases is that you can import the Asana content, including properties like title, assignee, completed and created date, description and more.
The content will update automatically, but can only be edited from within Asana, preventing any accidental changes to the information.
Though you can’t edit the database content, you can adjust the layout, and add filters and sorts to create different contextual views.
----
To create a synced Asana database, type the/command and selectAsana synced database. Then choose the Asana database you want to sync, and select whether you want to share synced content with Anyone on the page, or keep it private.
You can use link previews and synced databases across your workspace in many different ways.
For example:
Sync your content calendar across tools— If your content team plan and create content in Asana, the content calendar doesn’t have to stay hidden. Create a synced database in Notion, change the layout to board view, and everyone will be able to see what content is coming up next.
----
Provide all the necessary context to your product launch document— Lots of pieces have to come together for a successful product launch. If information is contained in different tools, you can bring it all together in one Notion page using link previews and synced databases.
Manage your social media calendar— Just like the content calendar, you can manage the big picture collaboration in Notion even if the social media team are happily working in Asana for more detailed tasks and reviews of copy.

Use Notion AI to give teams perfect memory, and save time
Traditional knowledge management tools can be difficult to use, and even harder to configure. As a knowledge manager, you spend hours crafting the perfect setup to enable your team to self-serve the information they need. So why does it feel like they can never find what you write?
With Notion, you can easily create a knowledge base for your internal teams. But what’s more, when team members need to get a question answered, all they have to do is ask Notion AI.
----
Notion’s Q&A function, powered by AI, searches through all of your relevant knowledge base articles to put together a concise answer. It even cites it’s sources. And unlike a generic chatbot, if it can’t find an answer, it won’t make one up.
In this guide, you’ll learn:
How teams can use Q&A to self-serve information
How to create a wiki to manage your knowledge base
How to set up permissions and onboard team members into your Notion knowledge base
When all of your information lives inside Notion, all your teammates need to do is ask a question, using normal language, and Notion AI will provide a response — citing any pages where that information lives.
How does Notion AI work?
Click to expand
----
Here are a few practical ways your teams can use this feature:
Software troubleshooting or help desk for IT teams —If a team member is addressing a software issue, they could use Notion AI to ask, "What are the common troubleshooting steps for our CRM software?" Provided this knowledge exists in your wiki, Notion AI would then provide a list of potential solutions, helping the team member to resolve the issue without having to create an IT help desk ticket.
Customer Support for CX agents —A CX agent could use Notion AI to ask, "What is our refund policy for subscription services?" Notion AI would then provide the specific information from your knowledge base, helping the CX agent to respond to customer inquiries accurately and efficiently.
----
Onboarding procedures for HR & managers —A new hire could ask, "What are the onboarding procedures for the marketing department?" Notion AI would then provide a concise overview of the relevant procedures, helping the new team member to get up to speed quickly.
Company policies for people teams —To understand "What is the company's remote work policy?", a team member could pose this question to Notion AI and get the information they need without having to search through the company handbook or ask in Slack.
----
Live objection handling for GTM teams —When your sellers and support agents are on calls with customers they need to instant access to the knowledge in your battle cards, competitive analysis, roadmap, and more. With Notion AI, all they need to do is ask a question, and they’ll get an instant response.
Asking questions in natural language can save as much as5 minutesof searching time per query, massively improving efficiency for your organization as it scales. So how do you get started?
The first step to using Notion as a home-base for your support team is centralizing all of your existing docs into Notion. We recommend using the wiki feature to do so, since it comes with extra properties for managing knowledge — like verification.
----
Import your content to skip this step
Click to expand
Every page in your wiki can be assigned an owner, and verification status, along with any other tags that are useful to your organization. To build a wiki, follow the steps below:
Prepare your content —Start by creating or identifying the pages that you want to include in your knowledge base. These could be existing pages in Notion that contain information on your team's processes, policies, or any other relevant content, or content that you’re moving from another tool.
Build your top-level page —Assemble all of the content you’ve identified into one page, with sub-pages. If you’re new to Notion, learn about creating pages and subpageshere.
----
Turn your page into a Wiki —Once you have your content ready, you can convert it into a wiki to unlock additional properties that will help manage your knowledge. To do this, navigate to the top-level page of your content, click on the three dots in the top right corner to open the page options menu, and select "Turn to wiki".
Update and maintain your Wiki —Remember that a knowledge base is a living resource. In your newly formed wiki you can assign owners to each article and set expiration dates on content. Learn more about building a wiki in Notionhere.
Once you’re ready to start inviting team members into Notion, you’ll want to learn about permissions.
----
As a knowledge manager you’re likely thoughtful about who can edit your content, and it's important to strike a balance between protecting the integrity of your information and allowing for collaborative knowledge creation. To this end, teamspaces allow you to configure nuanced permission levels that suit your needs.
In your teamspace settings, you can set the default permission level to “can view” for most members. Then, you can individually grant higher levels of access to content managers who need it.
This way, as you start to add members, they’ll have access to everything they need, but won’t be able to make any accidental changes.
Page permissions vs. Teamspace permissions

----
Finally, it’s time to add your team members to complete your Notion knowledge base roll-out.
In order to use Q&A, you’ll have to add your teammates as “members” to your workspace (not guests). Notion makes it easy to add users, depending on the size of your team and needs of your organization. You might:
Add members via email —if you know the email addresses for everyone that will need access to your knowledge base, you can add them manually under “Members.” This is ideal for smaller teams or to start testing your wiki with your close collaborators.
----
Add members via invite link —in theSettings & memberstab you can generate an invite link that will automatically add new members when clicked. You could include this in team member onboarding for a no-fuss management system.
Add members using SSO —enterprise plan customers can use SSO to add employees via SCIM. This allows IT administrators to better manage team access and keeps information more secure by automating off-boarding through SCIM.
Embracing Notion for your internal knowledge base management will help enhance your team's efficiency and information accessibility. Watch below to learn how it savedRemote.com$485k a year.
----
When you add Notion AI to your plan, you get access to all of it’s skills, not just Q&A. This means you can use it to improve writing, simplify tasks, augment daily work, and so much more. Here are just a few ways you might get started:
Write knowledge base articles faster —Simply provide a brief outline or a list of key points, Notion AI can generate a detailed and coherent draft, allowing you to focus on refining and customizing the content.
Make technical concepts easier to understand —As an IT or technical team you could ask Notion AI to re-write confusing documentation in a way that makes it easier for your non-technical stakeholders to understand. This saves you time, and reduces overall confusion for your teammates.
----
Draft responses for a customer —A thoughtful response can go a long way when solving a user’s problem. With AI writer, you can draft a few bullet points, and ask Notion AI to create a kind and direct response to their question.
Summarize meeting notes, and find action items —After a meeting, simply ask Notion AI to summarize the key points and highlight any action items. This can be particularly useful for long meetings or when you need to share the outcomes with team members who were not able to attend.

A user research database to help product teams take action on feedback
Product teams are always on the lookout for ways to improve the product, and often, they find answers by listening to users.
User research provides the context and perspective for everything you do, ensuring you create impactful features and remove points of friction. It’s a never-ending process of asking questions, listening, and taking action based on the opinions and experience of the people actually using your product.
Without a system to collect, reference, and execute on what you learn from users, you risk wasting time and resources building the wrong thing, or fixing what isn’t broken.
----
Using this Notion database, you’ll have one place for all your user research, where you can organize it based on your needs, and connect the dots between this research and the projects they impact.
Better databases have arrived!
While the concepts outlined in this guide are still useful, references to specific product actions may be a bit outdated! Databases were redesigned in March 2022, so your experience may differ slightly from what’s pictured and described here.This guideoutlines the new database features, including what's changed.
To get started recording user research, you can copy thistemplatestraight into your workspace, and customize it however you like.
----
To create your user feedback database, make a new page inside yourproduct team’s wikiusing the/command. In the menu that appears, chooseTable - Full pageand rename it “User Research” (you can also add an emoji to make it stand out if you like).
All the information in a database is organized by properties. Database properties allow you to categorize each database entry, and they can be customized based on the needs of that database. This gives you a high-level view of the most important information about each database entry — like the person responsible for the project, the type of project, and its timeline.  Learn more aboutall the database properties available in Notion here.
----
Open thePropertiesmenu at the top of the table and clickAdd a propertyto add a new one. When you add a new property, you can rename it and select what type of property you want from the list. Whether you want to know the user’s location, the length of your interview with them, or the topic discussed, properties help you customize how information in your database is categorized.
These are some properties you’ll want to include in your user research database:
Name— edit theTitleproperty, and call it "Name." This is where you will enter the name of each user.
Email— add anEmailproperty so you can enter the user’s email address. If you want to send them an email at any time, you can click on the@symbol, and this will open up a new email.
----
Phone number— add aPhoneproperty where you can type the user’s phone number, handy for interviews so you're not digging around last minute.
Interviewer— by adding aPersonproperty, you can tag the team member who conducted the interview. This will help you see which team members have conducted the most interviews.
Date— add aDateproperty to enter the date that the conversation took place.
Product feature— use aSelectproperty to identify which feature the feedback refers to, so you can understand at a glance what the conversation is about. You can start typing in the column to create new tags.
----
Status— add anotherSelectproperty to assign a status to the feedback. Creating tags like “Contacted,” “Scheduled,” “Completed,” or “Cancelled” will let everyone know whether the interview has taken place.
Completion time- you could add aNumberproperty to show the duration of the interview.
You can add as many properties as you like to capture all the information your product team needs. Each one is totally customizable, so as your team adds features, reaches back out to certain users, or improves processes, these properties can change based on the types of interviews your team is conducting.
----
Every item in the database opens up to become its own, fully customizable Notion page. Inside this page, you can store details of the user interview, including evidence of bugs, observations from the interviewer, and any action items that need to be taken care of.
Just start typing, or hit/to bring up the menu of blocks that you can add to a page. Everything in a Notion page is a block, and we have a full guide toall the different types of blocksyou can choose from. For now, though, here are a few you’ll find useful:
Text— chooseTextto start writing with plain text. You can type up notes from your interview, including the user feedback and any comments from the interviewer.
----
Bullets— selectBulleted listto organize your notes in a scannable format.
Checklist— use aTo-do listto list out any action items, or make sure certain questions were asked.
Headings— add h1s, h2s, and h3s to separate the different sections of your page.
Media— selectImageto embed screenshots, orVideoto include a screen recording of a bug or issue. You can also drag media from your desktop and drop it onto the page.
----
No matter the type of interview your team is doing, Notion pages are a blank canvas to capture everything that comes out of these interviews. And because databases are comprised of pages, you’re able to both organize your work and do the work in one place. No need to jump around between different pieces of software to check your notes, find a user’s email, or see the bug they experienced. In Notion, all your team’s most vital information lives in one place.
----
Documenting your user research thoroughly is essential, but the process can take time. Coming up with questions. Sending a thank you email. Remembering to remove biases. Starting from scratch for every single interview would bog your team down — and inevitably, things will slip through the cracks.
----
Usingdatabase templates, you can have all this information at the ready for your team with a single click, helping save them time and help them follow specific processes you’ve put in place. In these templates can be prompts to ask for screenshots of the problem, a reminder to thank the user for their time, and even a list of questions you want to ask in every interview. You can even create different templates for the types of interviews your team does.
As well as cutting down on repetitive work, templates allow product teams to design a uniform process of collecting feedback, meaning you follow the same criteria every time, consider edge cases, and cement your process.
To create a template in your User Research database:
----
Click on the drop-down next toNewand selectNew template.
A new page will open, and you’ll see that you are editing a template. Give your template a name, something likeUser Session.
You can customize the page content and add anything that you want to automatically populate every time. These might be some headers, likeUser Comments,Interviewer Observations, andAction Items. Under the headers, add some bullets or a to-do list.
When you close the page, your template will be saved. Whenever you go to that drop-down, you can select your template and create a new entry in the database based on the format you created.
----
You can create multiple templates, perhaps for different types of users, or categories like general feedback or reporting a problem.
These templates can even be updated when you or your team learns better questions or processes from interviews. Simply edit the template, and your team can take these learnings forward with every interview they have in the future. It also helps new teammates contribute from the start — everything they need to conduct an interview is right in the template.
Notion databases can havedifferent views, meaning that the same information can be sliced several different ways.
----
Want to see a calendar of all your interviews? How about the number of interviews each of your PMs did this week? Maybe you want to see interviews by the feature explored? Database views allow you to quickly pull up that information whenever you need it.
In your user research database, here are some ways you might use different views:
A calendar to keep track of interviews— seeing your interviews plotted on the calendar will make sure you never miss one. To add a calendar view, go toAdd a viewin the views dropdown. SelectCalendar. Database entries will appear on the date the interview is scheduled for or took place.
----
A board organized by status— group entries by status using a board view. You can create another view in the same way as before, this time selectingBoard. In theGroup byoption, make sureStatusis selected. You can add statuses like “Contacted,” “Scheduled,” and “Completed,” and drag and drop from one status to the next. This helps you differentiate between interviews that are scheduled, those that have gone ahead, and ones you’re still waiting for a response on.
----
Organize interviews by task— create a board view of your database that sorts interviews by what you spoke to the user about. To do this, go to the dropdown at the top left and clickAdd a view. Type to rename it “By task” and then hitCreate. When you go toGroup byand chooseTask, your user feedback will be categorized based on tasks they relate to.
Database views help managers surface the information they need in an instant. Product managers can even create custom views for just themselves, for example, to see the interviews they’re doing this week. Whatever info you need to pull up, database views are the way to go.
----
User research helps everyone understand why their projects matter. Product teams, designers, and engineers can trace their work back to real user needs, helping everyone get aligned behind the ultimate goal: to build a product users love.
Notion lets you build bridges between information across different databases usingrelation properties.
By linking your user research database to your projects database, you’ll provide team members with the tangible feedback and context behind every project. Engineers can link their product roadmap to the user research database and see what users think about a feature, and designers can view the user feedback that sparked certain design decisions.
----
Here’s how to create a relation between your user research and projects database:
Add a new property to your user research database, and this time pickRelationfrom the advanced property menu.
You’ll be prompted to select the database you want this one to relate to. From the dropdown, choose your projects database, and clickCreate relation.
You’ll see that a new column has appeared in your database, and you can rename thisProjects.
When you click in the projects column, you’ll be able to select any entry from your projects database. This means you can link any piece of user feedback to an ongoing project. Likewise, when you’re in your projects database, you’ll be able to see user feedback that relates to each project.
----
This gives your team (and any team using this database) helpful context for features, updates, or new products.

Using database templates
Database templates in Notion can streamline, and add structure to your workflows.
They're useful for teams—such as Engineering—that often need structured reports or entries.
Templates automate the creation process, with pre-filled structures and properties.
You can create a template by selectingNew Templatefrom the dropdown menu in your database.
Database templates can be edited, duplicated, and deleted as needed.
If a new page is created without selecting a template, it can still be transformed into a desired template later.
Templates can be used for structured meeting notes.
They can also be beneficial for personal use, like journaling.

Using database templates to help cement your team's process
1:1 meeting notes, project specs, reporting product bugs — your team likely has recurring tasks or documentation. But creating each of these from scratch, every time, can be time-consuming and inefficient.
In Notion, database templates help you quickly spin up pages for these recurring workflows, ready to go with frameworks customized to each project. Not only for speed, database templates also give you the opportunity to solidify a process for your team — like making sure there's action items from every meeting, or each bug reported has a screenshot.
Here, we’ll look at how you can use database templates to streamline tasks and create more clear-cut procedures for execution.
----
Database templates are pages unique to your database that you can use over and over again. Your meeting notes database can have a set of templates for different types of meetings (1:1s, stand-ups), or your tasks database can have templates unique to each type of task (bug fixes, project specs).
Imagine starting a meeting with sections for an agenda, updates, discussion notes, meeting participants, and action items already set up and ready for your team to add to. Or, when reporting a bug, there's a section in the template to reproduce that bug, so the engineering team can fix it without requiring a back-and-forth to get it done.
----
Database templates create structure that your team (or cross-functional teams) follows. Along with making information standardized and actionable, they ensure:
Projects start off on the right foot.
Edge cases are considered.
Your team has clear guidelines and standards.
Teammates can get and up running on a new project in minutes.
Your team is sharing learnings by updating templates.
Before we go any further, it’s helpful to know the difference between templates and database templates. Database templates live in any database within your team’s workspace.
These are different from the templates you may have seen and duplicated from ourTemplate Gallery— customizable pages you can use as a starting point for many of the pages in your workspace.
----
In this guide, we’ll be focusing on the templates that only exist in databases.
You can create database templates two ways:
1. Click the arrow next to the blueNewbutton at the top right of any database. Select+ New Template.
2. When creating a new page in a database, you'll also see the+ New templateoption in the body of the new page.
Templates in a database are only available in the specific database where you made and saved them.
By spending time upfront building out templates, you can get hours back in the long run. Since each database template is customizable to the work at hand, here's some ways you can mold them to your needs:
----
Properties— set default properties that auto-populate when using a specific template. For example, if someone’s reporting a bug, make sure it’s always categorized as a bug whenever the template is used. Or, if you have an engineer always responsible for bugs, you can make sure they’re automatically tagged in aPersonproperty every time that template is used.
----
Headers— establish a consistent experience to make skimming and finding the right information on a page easier. Let’s say you’re putting together a template so that anyone from marketing to HR can report product bugs. Consider having larger headers covering the bug description, supporting links, and screenshots illustrating the issue. Think of headers like sections of your template your team will need to fill out.
Prompts under headers— while you’ve got headers to help separate your information, underneath those headers you can include some context for what to include. Change the color to gray or italicize the text as a way to signal that it’s meant to be replaced.
----
Linked databases— this one is great for meeting notes, specifically. Include a linked database of projects launching that week or your team’s goals right at the top of your meeting notes to keep everything in perspective and teammates aligned.
When you create a template, you can use it again and again. Keep in mind also updating templates is always possible — and likely will happen collaborating with your team.
----
For example, a designer may pose a great question during a user research interview. Then you decide to add their question to the template, ensuring it’s asked in all future sessions. Select the dropdown on the right of the blueNewbutton from the top right of your database. You'll see a list of all database templates. Tap the•••icon to the right of the template you want to edit. ClickEdit. Then make any desired changes in the editing view that pops up, so learnings from anyone are carried forward for your team.
Notion also has template buttons
Click to expand
If you’re using a database for any work that’s similar or recurring, database templates can help you speed up the creation of database entries and ensure processes are being followed.
----
Here a few ideas you can use as a springboard to build out templates for some of your foundational databases:
Meetings— from weekly syncs to 1:1s, your team likely has a format for each of these meetings you can document in Notion. A 1:1 template might have sections for feedback. A standup might have sections for updates. Both might have places for action items. Using templates, you can customize each one so that it meets the needs of that meeting.
If you haven’t started your own meetings database yet, duplicate ourmeetings notes templateinto your team’s workspace. Then use the daily standup, ad hoc meeting, and other templates pre-baked inside.
----
Tasks— your product or engineering team likely has many small tasks on a daily basis, whether it’s updating snippets of code or swapping out visuals on your marketing site. Use database templates for the recurring tasks your team executes, and make sure that each has its own property that auto-populates as part of that template. That way, they can spend time solving problems instead of making sure all the elements are there to solve problems in the first place.
Launch a team-wide task database usingthis to-do template. Then use the task database template within it to assign out work.
----
Docs— cut down how long it takes to document process changes or product specs by creating database templates for these recurring responsibilities. Let’s say you want your team to have a creative brief template to make sure all the information is available for a designer to knock it out of the park. Yourcreative brief templatecan request anyone that fills out the brief include goals, target audience, the defined deliverables, and anything else you’d like.
Get started building the default format for your frequently used documents withthis template. There you’ll find pre-saved templates for project kickoff, technical specs, and other documents.

Using Notion AI to extend your impact
Artificial intelligence (AI)refers to human-produced technology that systematically applies large sets of data to an iterative model. This allows it to predict results, generating mathematical or linguistic outputs in response to an input by the user of the AI.
It finds patterns in a massive set of data, referred to as training data, to create a model
It then tests its model by asking a question it already knows the answer to, and analyzing how accurate its answer is. The data generated by the AI is referred to as test data
Over time and with more inputs and test data, it learns and iterates on the model
A quick note
----
Artificial intelligence is an extremely complex science made up of machine learning, neural networks, cognitive computing, and so much more. While we aim to give you practical context behind Notion’s new AI features, this guide is not a comprehensive resource to learn about artificial intelligence.
Use Notion AI as a partner in thought to get started, or when you feel stuck on what’s next. Some of the current functions include:
Summarize existing content— after you’ve written something, Notion’s AI can extract key points in a high-level summary. Handy for quickly recapping research proposals, product specs, or meeting notes!
----
Brainstorm ideas— sometimes inspiration strikes right when we need it, but when writers’ block gets in the way, you can ask Notion AI to generate a list of names for your startup, or costumes for an upcoming party.
Write a rough draft— whether it’s a blog post, instagram caption, email, or poem, Notion’s AI can pull from millions of examples to craft a jumping off point for your writing. Some sentences might be great, others… not so much. That’s where the fun begins: editing and crafting the perfect final draft that is distinctly you.
Fix spelling and grammar— Notion AI also has a built-in spell check and grammar correction feature. No more worrying about pesky typos or misplaced comma. Notion AI will take care of it for you!
----
Translate content— easily convert your written content into another language!
What else can I do?
For a full list of Notion AI features, visithttps://www.notion.so/product/ai.
All AI outputs are limited and AI continues to be an area of rapid research and development. Limitations in AI as a whole can be attributed to many different causes, including but not limited to: narrow inputs, systemic biases, limited quantity of training or test data, or poor quality of training or test data.
As a consequence, Notion AI:
may output incorrect information.
may output harmful content when prompted.
may not know about recent events occurring in the last 6-12 months and may output inaccurate or outdated results.
----
may contain bias and output biased responses.Learn more about AI bias →
Artificial intelligence and machine learning models can improve over time to better address specific use cases. Notion AI is the same — the feature will continue to get better in the coming months. Plus, you can always use the 👍 👎 buttons in your Notion workspace anytime you use Notion AI, to flag any inappropriate responses to our engineers.
What about privacy?
Your data is still encrypted and private following our standarddata protection practices.

How visual link previews can streamline team collaboration
Think of every project like a wheel. Engineering, product, and design often sit at the hub. They’re working cross-functionally with other teams, using a mismatched set of tools — which means information lives many places.
And when information is everywhere, it has the ability to be lost, outdated, or flat-out wrong. There needs to be an underlying layer connecting all these teams, tools, and information.
We’ve seen technical leaders bring teams together on Notion, from individual projects to wikis and documentation.
----
And now, with link previews — a feature built on Notion’s API — you can see live updates of information from other tools right inside your Notion pages, even when authentication is required. We recently launched new link previews integrations with Figma, Dropbox, and Microsoft’s OneDrive & Sharepoint — so whether it’s the most recent Figma file or a Dropbox asset updated seconds ago, link previews unite teams by giving them access to the information they need to execute.
Link previews give you the ability to see real-time, synced visualizations of external files right inside your Notion pages. We’ve put together ahandy guidethat teaches you the specifics of how to use them, but we’ll summarize here:
----
Paste the link from a supported tool in your Notion page.
Select the format you’d like to see the link — a preview, which shows an enlarged visualization, or a mention, which shows up in-line
Authenticate your account to sync the tool and see live updates. Once you’ve authenticated your account, everyone who has access to the Notion doc will be able to see the preview – making it easier to share information across teams.
After granting access, all your need to do is paste the link once to get ongoing updates from whatever tool you’re previewing.
----
If you paste a link into Notion that does not support link previews, such as with an embedded link, you’ll need to provide individual access to the file, or for that file to be publicly available for you to see it in Notion.
Learn more about link previews
Click to expand
Embeds require individual access to a file, or for that file to be publicly available for you to see it in Notion. For example, previously if you were sharing a Figma file, you’d have to share it with specific people in Figma for them to view it in Notion, or make it a public link. Now with link previews, you can authenticate once and easily share authenticated content through Notion.
----
When you bring a design from Figma into Notion, your teammates can see it without taking up seats on your Figma plan. Similarly, you can control access to that design through theSharesettings of your page, rather than risking it being publicly accessible on the web.
What tools can I bring into Notion?
Click to expand
Break down the barriers of visual communication by connecting teams with link previews. Whether it’s a style guide for your brand team or a home base for your project, access to updated assets and information is key.
----
Too often, as more teammates use Dropbox or OneDrive, it becomes difficult to keep files organized. And if you’re working on a project, screenshots just don’t do it — they become outdated almost immediately, like a car that loses value after you drive it off the lot.
Here are some ways you can use link previews to make sure your teams have the most updated information they need to execute:
----
Create a project page as a single source of truth— consolidate information by creating a single Notion page for your project. In that page, you can add any visuals as link previews, giving cross-functional teams the ability to provide feedback on the latest mockups and see them all in one place. Sounds better than sending (and re-sending!) countless updates over Slack and email, right?
To get even more granular, you can link to a specific ‘node’ within your Figma design file to share the exact design image you want people to see.
----
Share eye-catching slide decks— with OneDrive and Sharepoint previews, you can paste a Powerpoint as a preview. Contextualized with the other designs, assets, and words on your page, the deck becomes a lot more valuable to all members of your team.
Build a wiki that has all your updated assets— along with processes and brand guidelines, your design team’s wiki might have visual assets, like logos or typography. Add those all as link previews, so nothing is outdated. For example, when the comms team needs a logo to share with press, they’ll be able to view the most updated one in your wiki, instead of digging around old files in Dropbox or OneDrive.
----
With link previews, you’re getting live updates from designs files, images, docs, screenshots, and more. That makes your information even more valuable because it’s useable without friction. Instead of searching around files called “Logo: use this one! [2021]” or “Logo: V6 [deprecated],” information is simply where you expect it to be. Plus, when link previews live alongside other information in Notion, it becomes a hub for all your work.
Design doesn’t happen in a vacuum — whether it’s feedback, new iterations, or important context, there are usually many factors leading to why something was designed the way it was.
----
Let’s say your product team is leading a redesign of your app. There are many steps in that process, with feedback being one. Here’s how link previews can make that process smoother:
Keep high-level discussion in one place— your designers may have granular discussions about hex codes and margin widths in Figma, but they can come back to Notion to share the 1-2 important takeaways with the group of stakeholders. Keeping the right people informed about the right things, without any information getting lost is the key to moving quickly at scale.
Good comment culture can help your team stay aligned
Click to expand
----
Add link previews to database templates— whenever your design team starts a new project, you can use a template that prompts them to add previews through a database template. This keeps expectations clear, and will help your team to adopt link previews even faster.
Work with stakeholders where they need to be— foundational teams like legal need the robust functionality of OneDrive, while designers need the visual tools in Figma. Create a process that unites them. Link previews brings information from many tools together in one place securely, giving teams a place to collaborate without access and tooling issues.
----
Bringing information under one digital roof in an easily accessible, visible way will help your team to collaborate more efficiently, and reduce the need for endless questioning and searching to find the right files. Link previews are just another way to find the clarity that we all need.

When to use each type of database view
Databases are one of Notion’s powerhouse features. They allow teams to store diverse, complex information and customize how they see it.
You have several distinct types of databases — a table, board, calendar, etc. — all of which can be used as different views of a single database. This is helpful when you need to slice a large set of data in many ways. You could have a company-wide roadmap that’s a table, and then create different views within that roadmap, like a calendar for your launches, a list of projects for each team, or a timeline for a specific project.
----
With database views, teams can surface the information they need in an instant. What’s more, every entry opens up as its own Notion page, and you can add text, images, files, and much more inside to neatly bundle all project info in one place.
Teams are able to create different views of the same database, giving them the flexibility and the freedom to view information however best suits them.
Here’s how you might use database views:
When you have one large information set used by cross-functional teams — whether it’s your roadmap or a company-wide list of tasks, different teams can create their own views of the database. That way, engineering can view their tasks without seeing all the marketing work as well.
----
If you have sub-teams as part of your team — if you have a table of engineering projects, each sub-team can have their own view, like one for the infrastructure team and one for the backend team. This fosters transparency, because there’s visibility into what the entire engineering org is working on, but specific teams can choose to focus on their work.
Your teams are juggling many projects at once — let’s say your marketing team has a master list of everything they’re working on. Some tasks are for the website redesign project. You can create a board of all the tasks related to that project to see their statuses. You can also create a view that's organized by teammate, to see what everyone has on their plate.
----
There’s no limit to how you can display, organize, and resurface your data. Your one database has the capability to be many custom databases, depending on your team’s needs. And once you make database views, you can reuse them anytime you need to surface that information.

Different teams have different needs — and there’s likely a database view to present information in the most effective way for that team.

Each row in the table is its own Notion page. This makes storing information for projects or tasks super organized — you can nest infinite sub-pages in these pages, say, for a large project with many parts.
Each column is a property related to those pages. These might be a launch date, a project owner, or a tag you’ve assigned the project. You can toggle on the properties you want to see in your table and hide the ones you don’t.
Drag-and-drop rows or columns to organize the table any way you’d like.
When should your team use it?
----
To organize a large set of team- or company-wide projects and tasks. Tables are great for getting a high-level look at information in a glance — like a project owner and its timeline — fostering transparency (you can go into these pages if you want to get granular). Teams can even make custom table views based on their work or specific projects, like a burndown list for a launch.
Learn more abouttables.
Project managers love the drag-and-drop functionality of board view, allowing you to move pages seamlessly based on their status.
What is it?
Just like any Notion database, each card in the board view is its own page. You can choose whichpropertiesyou display on these pages depending on what you need, like a due date or the project manager.
----
Columns in the board view can be three types of properties:Select,Multi-select, orPerson. You can add as many columns as you need.
When should your team use it?
To manage your projects. In a blink, see where all your projects sit. You can customize columns to match your process, like the rounds of editing you might have on a blog post. And you can even keep all the drafts inside those pages, so everything stays organized.
To see the types of projects your team is working on. UsingSelectorMulti-selectproperties, you can group your board by project type, like seeing all the front-end projects your eng team is working on.
----
To see who’s working on what. It’s easy for certain members of high-velocity teams to get overloaded with projects. Create a board view that’s grouped by your PMs to see the projects they’re managing.

Timeline view helps you visualize the length of projects and get ahead of upcoming deadlines.
What is it?
A Gantt chart where you can see project scopes. There’s also a table on the left side which you can hide or toggle on to view. You can toggle on whatever properties you want to see on the timeline pages.
----
All items need a start and end date to display on the timeline. Commonly, you’ll use the execution dates for projects, but you can also sort by launch date.
To extend the length of a project or move it all together, just use drag-and-drop.
When should your team use it?
When planning many tasks related to a large project. You can see all the tasks that are active at any one time, meaning you can distribute them evenly and avoid overload. You can also customize how you see these pages, whether it’s by hours, days, weeks, months, or quarters.
----
It's handy when you want to visualize what your team is working on. Viewing data chronologically helps project managers get the full picture of ongoing work and upcoming deadlines to prioritize accordingly. You can get granular by viewing the day, or zoom out to see the entire quarter. And you can adjust everything on the fly as real-life stuff shifts projects timelines.
Read all abouttimelines.
Great for planning and seeing important dates at once.
What is it?
A calendar where you can plot items by date, and each entry opens up as its own page. To create a new page quickly, hover over the day and hit+. You can choose which properties to display on these pages to help you plan.
----
Database items can be dragged from one day to the next to change the date, which will be reflected in your database. Say a launch date changes. When you move it in the calendar, the new launch date will display in your table.
When should your team use it?
For high-level planning, like all your feature launches for the month or scheduling social media posts.
Cross-functional or company-wide work, where everyone needs to be informed of what’s going on.
Learn about more ways to usecalendars.
A minimalist database view best used to collect certain types of pages.
What is it?
A simple, clean view which shows individual pages in a list.
----
You can add properties to help organize your pages, but you don’t have to display them all in the list. Toggle on what you want to see, hide what you don’t.
When should your team use it?
List views are great for shared documentation, such asmeetings notes or company-wide documentswhere you don’t need a ton of properties to organize them. Your team might have all their meeting notes in a list database, with properties designating the type of meeting and its attendees.
Find out more aboutlists.
Creative thinkers (like design teams!) use gallery view to put visuals front-and-center.
What is it?
----
An eye-catching way to organize pages visually in a grid where you can showcase images. We’ve seen it used for a team’s design system or as an inspiration board.
You can customize galleries a few ways: the size of the pages, which image you want displayed, and which properties you want to see on those pages. Customize everything in thePropertiesmenu.
When should your team use it?
Galleries are perfect for any visual work, like mood boards and branding materials (fonts, logos, brand colors, etc.).
HR teams also use them toshowcase new teammates in the employee directoryand display their headshots on the page. This helps remote teams put a face to new names.

How to write Notion formulas that extend the capabilities of your databases
Tempted to dip your toes into formulas, but not sure where to start?
Formulas make your databases even more powerful. You can extract useful data, run calculations and go beyond Notion’s out-of-the-box options to build custom database properties showing exactly what you need to see.
In this guide, you’ll discover how to write formulas and different ways to use them.

----
Notion has a wide range of database properties that help you organize and store information. Formulas multiply the power of properties by letting you run calculations and perform operations using the information entered in properties. Results appear across the entire database, and can save you spending time on manual data entry.
To put it another way, if Notion blocks were legos, formulas would be the expansion packs allowing you to build the exact system you need with your own custom properties.
To add a formula to your database, select Formula in the properties menu, and clickEdit propertyto start writing your formula. Formulas apply across the whole row of a database to calculate, modify or reformat information.
----
Before we get into examples of formulas, we’ll start by defining some Notion formula terminology.
Notion formulas work on existing properties in your database to produce an output. Unlike a spreadsheet, the formula applies to the entire property.
In the formula editor, you’ll find all the different components (think of them like recipe ingredients) you can combine to produce your desired results. You can either select these ingredients from the menu on the left, or type out your formula in the box above.
----
At the highest level, formulas perform actions on your existing database properties. These actions can be anything from simple mathematical operations — like adding number columns — to complex, pre-defined functions like finding the amount of time between two dates.
When writing a formula, you have to choose inputs (the properties you want to perform operations or functions on) then explain the action you want to perform. Then, your output (or result) will be displayed in the database.
To begin your formula, you need to have inputs. These can either be database properties, constants such aspi, or literal values that you will type in.
----
When you use database properties as inputs, the results will change according to how those properties are completed, and will show different results in each row if property values are different.
Functions are the instructions of your formula that explain the actions you want to perform on the inputs.
This could be anything from multiplying one value by another, subtract one from another, or modifying or reformatting an input in some way.
Operators can be arithmetic calculations, or comparisons testing one input value against another — for example to see whether one value is larger or not, or whether a Status property is marked as Complete.
A concatenation operator combines text or numbers, for example to combine a first and last name.
----
You can select any properties in the database as inputs. Then, you can perform actions on these using the following elements:
Functions— Predefined formulas that you can combine into a larger formula. These are more advanced operators that already include inputs, such asdateAddto add a certain number of days, months, or years to a date,toNumber()to convert text to a number, orreplaceAll()to search text for a pattern and replaces all matches with some other text.
----
Built-ins— Built-in operators and values you can use in formulas. Operators can be arithmetic (+,-, etc), comparisons (>to show to greater of two values,==to test if two values are the same) or concatenations (+when used on text will combine both values). Built-in values includetrueandfalse.
Person and page metadata— Reference metadata that isn't part of the database, including a person’s email address or name (person.email(),person.name()), and individual page blocks (block.prop("Created By"),block.prop("Last Edited Time"))
Outputsfrom your formulas can be in any of the following formats, which include many property types in databases:
Text
Numbers
Boolean/checkbox (true or false values)
Dates
People
Pages
Lists
----
Pay attention to the data type you are working with.
Click to expand
In order to write functioning formulas that return a correct value you need to know how to compose formulas.
Formulas can range from one simple input to an combination of several calculations that produce a single value.
Your formula will need to contain different elements depending on the value you want to produce, and most formulas will contain several operations that must be nested and sequenced correctly.
Here’s how to write a Notion formula in 3 steps:
----
Step 1: Define what you want to achieve— Before you write the formula you must define the output or result you’re hoping for. Remember that outputs can be in the form of any Notion data type — text, people, number, checkbox, block or date.
Step 2: Figure out the inputs you need— Consider what values and information you need to input in order to produce your desired result. Think about the existing properties in the database — are there any more properties you need to add? Your formula can contain a mixture of properties, operators and functions.Some useful operators and functions you might include in your formulas:
dateAdd— dateAdd takes a date input and adds to it, returning a new date. Similar functions aredateSubtractanddateBetween.
----
if— Allows you to writeif-thenstatements in a Notion formula. These statements contain a condition to be evaluated for truthfulness, plus athenstatement (if the condition is true) and anelsestatement (if the condition is false.)
contains— tests whether the first argument contains the second argument (only accepts text.)
format— Useformat()to reformat dates, booleans, numbers and more to text.
All formula components
Click to expand
Step 3: Write and test your formula— Use the built-in and help center documentation to compose your formula, test and check your results to make sure it works! Pro-tip: test your formula in smaller bits to make sure you’re getting the desired output at each step.
Nesting functions in your formulas
Click to expand
----
Now we’ve gone through formula fundamentals, here are 5 examples you can try out in your own databases.
If you have two or more properties in your database you can run calculations like add, subtract, divide multiply, etc.
Calculations save you from manually entering data (and reduce the risk of human error.)
In a database where you enter all your invoices, create a number property to introduce the net amount of each invoice and another for the percentage of tax.
Next, create a formula property to calculate the amount of tax per invoice.
prop("Net ") * prop("Tax (%)")
Using another formula property, calculate the gross by adding the tax to the net amount.
prop("Net ") + prop("Tax ($)")
----
Calculations can be used in many other ways, like calculating commission on sales or converting units of measurement, such as centimeters to feet and inches or Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Notion formulas perform calculations across properties
Click to expand
If you use a Notion database to collect ideas and feedback, you can use an Upvote formula to easily count the number of votes for each entry.
In a database containing new feature ideas, topic suggestions for a meeting, or product updates that need to be prioritized, people can “Upvote” entries by tagging themselves in a Person property.
Once you’ve added a Person property called “Upvoted by”, you can then enter the following formula:
length(prop("Upvoted by"))orprop("Upvoted by").length()
----
This will add up the number of people in the “Upvoted By” column, and display that as a number.
You could modify this formula to count the number of attendees at a meeting or event, or show how many people are collaborating on a project.
With date formulas, calculate the amount of time passed since a date, days to go until a future date, or amount of time between two dates.
You can also use dynamic dates in formulas — last year, next month, a week from today, etc.
In a project or task management database, use a formula like this to calculate how much time you have left until a project is due.
dateBetween(prop("Due date"), now(), "days")
----
Date formulas are versatile, and they could also be used in a team database to calculate everyone’s age by subtracting their date of birth from today’s date, and to calculate how long each team member has been at the company.
format(round(dateBetween(now(), prop("Joined"), "days") / (365 / 12) * 10) / 10) + " months"
The+operator can combine text, or numbers (by first converting the number to text). In a team’s People database, you might have two columns for first and last names. Then, a third “Full name” column, a formula would combine both names.
prop("First name") + " " + prop("Last name")
----
Another use case for this is generating URLs by converting different tags to text, then combining them into a URL. Like in the case of this UTM link generator:
ifs(empty(prop("URL")),"", empty(prop("UTM Source")) or empty(prop("UTM Medium")) or empty(prop("UTM Campaign")),"You must enter medium, source and campaign name.",prop("URL") + "?utm_source=" + prop("UTM Source") + "&utm_medium=" + prop("UTM Medium") + "&utm_campaign=" + prop("UTM Campaign"))
Relation properties bring information from one database into another. If you want to filter the information coming into your database through a relation, you can do so using a formula.
----
For example, you may have a projects database that’s related to your meetings database, and want to filter the related meetings to only show upcoming meetings.
You can filter related meetings where the date is later than “now”.
prop("Meetings").filter(current.prop("Date") > now())
If your formulas aren’t written correctly, you’ll get an error message when you try to click save. Sometimes, Notion will give you a hint as to what might be wrong - whether it’s a missing bracket or input, or incorrect operation.
However, if you’re not sure why a formula isn’t working, here are some things you can try:
----
Check that you’ve correctly nested operations into parentheses— If your formula contains several functions, you need to make sure each action is separated and contained with a set of brackets.
Reference database properties accurately— The formula editor is case sensitive, and will only recognize inputs that are exactly the same. When referencing a property, make sure to type it exactly as it is in the database, or just select it from the menu.
Check for list data types— When you’re trying to perform a calculation on a list data type (like people properties or relation properties), you may need to first map your data so that the calculation can be preformed one list “entry” at a time.
----
Ensure data types match up— Check that your data types match in your formula. You can’t perform calculations with numbers that are contained in text, or join numbers and text without converting the format first. If you’ve mixed data types in a formula you may get a “Type mismatch” error message.
Test your formulas— You may not be able to tell if a formula is working if there’s only one or two entries in a database. Try changing the inputs (property values) or adding more database entries to check that your formula is working as it should.

Notion’s SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.
To get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you'll need to complete the following steps:
Verify domain(s):To use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domain’s DNS to verify your ownership of it.
Enable SAML SSO:This will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration. For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer tothis article.
----
Change default login method:Once SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set toAny method, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this toOnly SAML SSO, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace for managed users with verified company emails.
Link additional workspaces:If you have more than one workspace you’d like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out toteam@makenotion.com.
----
Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there’s an IdP/SAML SSO failure.
Unique User Identification
Assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity.
----
Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de-provision members and groups. Workspace owners can find the required API key by going toSettings & members→Security & identity→SCIM Configurationand clicking to view the token.Please seeour SCIM documentationfor the latest information on how you can interact with Notion’s SCIM API. Notion supports official SCIM applications with Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.

How to protect yourself from malvertising
At Notion, we prioritize the safety and trust of our users. As part of this commitment, we share tips on online safety. One key area of focus is combating "Malvertising", a common cyber threat where online ads are used to distribute malicious software.
Malvertising is a method where cybercriminals misuse online advertising platforms to distribute malware. They accomplish this by creating ads that mimic trusted brands, such as Notion, and deceiving users into downloading their malicious software.
----
If you accidentally download and install malware thinking it's the official Notion app, your device and personal data may be at risk. This could lead to your account being compromised, personal information getting exposed, and potential data loss.
Download apps from trusted sources:Only download the Notion app from theApp Store,Google Play Store, orNotion’s website. Avoid third-party app stores or ad links.
Exercise caution with online ads:Avoid clicking on ads that seem suspicious or overly enticing. It's safer to ignore ads that are unfamiliar or seem unusual.
----
Keep your software up-to-date:Regularly update your device's operating system and apps. These updates often include security enhancements that guard against known vulnerabilities, which could be exploited by malware.
Use security software:Install trusted security software on your device. Ensure it's always up-to-date and perform regular malware scans.
Stay informed:Keep up-to-date with the latest cyber threats and effective protection strategies. Knowledge is your strongest defense in cybersecurity. There are various ways to keep yourself informed. Here’s alistof some excellent sources.
----
Remember, if you land on a Notion download page, verify it isnotion.so/download. If you encounter any activity that seems suspicious and involves Notion, please report it to us viasecurity@makenotion.com.
Your safety and trust are our top priorities. We continually strive to protect our brand and users from threats. By staying alert and following these steps, you can contribute to this protective effort.

Which versions of Confluence are supported?
We officially support importing from Confluence Cloud, in pages created using the new editor that Confluence introduced in late 2018.
Due to insufficient data in its index export, we do not support importing from Confluence Server.
----
For help importing an entire workspace from the legacy editor, please contact support atteam@makenotion.com.
Do imported blocks count towards the storage limit for Free Plan workspaces with multiple members?
No, imported blocks will not count towards the limit. However, any blocks subsequently created inside imported pages will count towards the limit as usual.
Is there a maximum import size for Confluence imports?
Confluence imports are limited to 5GB for zip-file imports and 30 GB for API imports.
If you run into the limit, you can try using theCustom Exportoption to select pages for export, omitting attachment-heavy pages.
When I try to import from Confluence, I can't choose my file in the file upload window.
----
Please make sure to upload a.zipfile created by the Confluence space export functionality. Word documents and standalone HTML files will not work, since Notion relies on the whole import to preserve structure and links between pages.
I can't find the option to export my Confluence workspace.
If the "Export" tab does not appear in the Content Tools section of a workspace's settings, you may not have the appropriate permissions to export pages. Ask the workspace administrator for permission.

Intro to databases
There are three things that make Notion databases unique:
Every item is its own page:Every item you enter into your database is a Notion page. Open a database item to add more information in the form of text, images, and more, as you would with any other Notion page!
You can customize properties:Add properties to contextualize, label, and augment any database item with things like dates, status, and links.Learn more about database properties here →
You can toggle between multiple views:Your data isn't limited to a table. Visualize the information in a database as a list, calendar, chart, and more— whatever makes the information most useful.Learn more about views, filters, and sorts here →
----
Every full-page database has the same menus and sets of options. Here's a quick walkthrough.
Views: Edit and switch between all the differentviewsof your database. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view to see your other views.
Add a new view: Add a new view to your database, with its own layout, filters and sorts. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and selectAdd view.
Filter menu:Apply filters based on property values. When you apply a filter to a database, only you can see it to start, but you can save them to the view for your entire shared team if you prefer!
----
Sort menu:Sort your data by a property. Like filters, sorts are only visible to you by default, but you can make them visible to your whole team as well.
Database search:Type in any word, whether it's in the name of a database item or in a property, and your database will only show items that fit that search query.
••• menu:Located at the top right of your database, this allows you to edit your view layout, grouping, properties, and more.
Create a new database page:Click this to add a new page to your database. Depending on your screen size, this may appear as+orNew. Open the dropdown next to this button to access and edit any database templates you've configured.
----
To create a database in Notion, open a new or existing Notion page and type/followed by thetype of database viewyou’d like to start with, liketableorboard.
When you create a database, you can start from scratch or pull in data from another part of your workspace.
If you want to use the same properties or an existing view of a database, we suggest selecting an existing data source. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.
If the information you're adding to the database doesn’t exist anywhere else in your workspace, we suggest creating a new data source.
Full-page databases
Full-page databases appear just like any other page in your sidebar.
----
You can lock a full-page database so that other people can't change properties and value options by selecting•••at the top of your database →Lock database.
To turn a full-page database into an inline database, drag the database into another page in the sidebar, which will turn it into a subpage. Then navigate into the page, and select⋮⋮→Turn into inline.
Inline databases
Controls and menus for your inline database are hidden until you hover over it.
You can expand an inline database to a full-page database by selecting⤡at the top.
You can turn an inline database into a full-page database by clicking⋮⋮and dragging it into the sidebar as a top-level page.
----
You canDelete,Duplicate, move, or copy the link to your inline database by selecting⋮⋮, which will appear on hover to the side.
In your sidebar, your inline database will appear as a subpage of the page it's in.
You can make a copy of a database.
For inline databases:
Hover over the database, then select⋮⋮.
SelectDuplicate. You can choose toDuplicate with contentor, if you want to use the same database setup to organize other pages,Duplicate without content.
For full pages:
Click the•••button in the top right.
SelectDuplicate. You can choose toDuplicate with contentor, if you want to use the same database setup to organize other pages,Duplicate without content.
----
Every item in your database, whether it's a row in a table or a card on a board or calendar, is its own Notion page that you can build, format, and nest content in like any other page.
To add database items:
For all databases: Click the blueNewbutton at the top right.
For atable,listorboard: Click+ Newat the bottom to add a new item.
For acalendar: Click the+icon that appears when you hover over any day. This creates a new event on that day.
For agallery: Click the+ Newbutton in the empty card at the bottom of your gallery to add a new image frame right there.
To open database items as pages:
Intables, hover over your first column and click theOPENbutton that appears.
Inlists, just click on the title of the item.
----
Inboards,calendars, andgalleries, click anywhere on the card.
Pages will always open in a peek preview. Click⤡at the top left to view in full-page mode.
In this page, you'll see all your database properties at the top. Each row is one property, with a name, type, and a value. Click on the value to edit.
Click the⋮⋮that appears to the left of each property on hover in order to: drag it up or down, change theProperty type, rename it,DuplicateorDeleteit.
Underneath your properties is free page space, where you can add any type of content block, including sub-pages or an in-line database.
Because database items are pages, any other type of content you drag into a database (like bullets or to-do items), will automatically turn into pages.
----
Right click on an item to reveal a list of actions. Those actions include:
Delete: Deletes the item from your database.
Duplicate: Creates an exact copy of the item.
Copy link: Copies an anchor link to that specific item to your clipboard.
Rename: Lets you rename the page in your row without opening it.
Move to: Lets you move the row to another workspace or page (where it will show up as a subpage).
Edit property: Brings up a menu with all your table's properties. Click the one you want and then click the new value for it.
The top section of any page in a Notion database can include several things:
Propertiesprovide data about the page you're looking at, like project owner, due date, tags, and more.
----
Commentscapture conversation between you and your teammates. You can use them to tag each other, ask questions, provide feedback and more.
Backlinksindicate all the pages that link to the current page so you can easily navigate between them.
As with everything in Notion, you can customize the look and feel of these components. To access these options:
Click the•••at the top right of any Notion page in a database and selectCustomize page.
Forproperties, you can use this menu to choose which property fields you want to show at the top of the page, and how. For each one, select from:
Always show:Nothing changes, you continue to see the property field.
----
Hide when empty:The property field will disappear from the top of your page if it has no value in it.
Always hide:The property field will not show up at the top of your page.
You can also access theCustomize pagemenu by clicking the⋮⋮icon next to any property in the list at the top of your database page. This⋮⋮icon can also be clicked and dragged up or down to reorder how properties are displayed on your page.
Tip:If you have a database with dozens of properties, hiding some properties is a great way to keep your pages clear.
Note:When you hide properties, they get aggregated in a single menu item at the bottom of the list. You can click this to easily show any hidden properties.
Forbacklinks, you can choose:
----
Expanded:See all the pages that link to the current page listed in full.
Show in popover:In case you don't want to see all the pages, you can choose to see just the number of backlinks. Click to open a popup displaying all the pages.
Off:Just hide all backlinks entirely.
Forcomments, you can choose to show them:
Expanded:Show the full conversation at the top of the page.
Off:Hide comments on the page for a minimalist view.
When using a database in a shared workspace, Notion has features in place to prevent accidental edits that could impact other teammates.

Scroll to the Teamspaces label in your sidebar and click the+button to the right of the label.
Give your teamspace a name, description, and icon.
Choose the access settings for your teamspace. There are three options:
Open:Anyone can join and view the content inside this teamspace.
Closed:Everyone can see that this teamspace exists, but can’t join unless they’re invited by an owner or member.
Private (Business and Enterprise Plans only):Only members or owners of this teamspace can invite other people, and it won’t be visible to people who are not added.
----
Once you’ve populated all of these fields, selectCreate teamspace.
You can turn an existing page into a teamspace if:
You haveFull accessto the existing page in question.
The page is in a teamspace.

Intro to workspaces
Your Notion app interface is split into two sections: the sidebar and the editor.
Notion's expandable sidebar is your navigation system.
All the pages and databases you create will appear here.
The sidebar contains several sections, which you can reorder and customize.
You can nest pages inside each other for infinite levels of organization.
It's also home to your settings, trash, and other tools.
Learn more about your sidebar inthis article →
This is where all the content you create lives.
Control menus are at the top (we'll go through those in more detail), but otherwise, Notion's editor is a blank canvas for you to write, plan, brainstorm, etc.
----
You'll notice that as soon as you start typing in this space, those top menus fade into the background, leaving you with your thoughts in a spacious zone of focus.
The control panel at the top of your sidebar contains several key features:
Workspace switcher:Click on your current workspace's name to switch between the workspaces you belong to, create a new one, join another one, or log out.Learn more about switching workspaces here →
Search:Click to open Notion's search window, where you can either type in what you're looking for or quickly jump to a recently visited page.Learn more about Search here →
Home:Click to see the pages and tasks that need your attention.Learn more about Home here →
----
Inbox:Click to see all your notifications in one place. This menu combines revisions that were made on pages you follow, mentions of you across your workspace, and new work assignments. A red notification badge will appear here when you have unread notifications.Learn more about inbox here →
Your sidebar contains various sections to keep your workspace’s content organized:
Teamspace:This section is accessible for users on paid plans to manage the various teams or groups that may be working in Notion. Learn more about teamspaceshere →
Shared:This section contains pages that you and select others in your workspace have access to.
Private:This section is home to pages that only you have access to.

Trashcontains all the pages you delete. You can drag and drop them in here. You can also click on trash to search, view and restore these pages.
----
Favoritesis where you can easily access all of the pages most important to you. This section will appear in your sidebar once you favorite your first page.
To add a page to your favorites, navigate to it, then click ⭐ at the top of it. You'll see it appear underFavoritesin your sidebar.
To remove a page from your favorites, open it and unclick ⭐ at the top. You can also hover over the page in your sidebar and click•••. You'll see the option toRemove from Favorites.
Tip:Favorites are helpful for stashing pages relevant to your current projects. You can easily add or remove them as your workflow and priorities change.
There are a few ways to add a new page in Notion.
Click📝at the top of your left sidebar.
----
If you’re on the desktop app, use the shortcutcmd/ctrl+N.
If you’re on mobile, tap📝at the bottom of your screen.
When you hover over a page in your sidebar, you'll see both a+button to add a page nested inside it, and a•••icon, which opens a menu of actions you can apply to the page:Delete,Duplicate,Copy link,Rename, andMove to.
Always know where you are in respect to your page structure. See how the page you're currently looking at fits into other pages.
You can click on any page in this breadcrumb to immediately jump to it. Sometimes this will be abridged with a...— click to view all the pages in between.
----
You can see the profile photos of everyone else who has access to the page you're on. If you hover over any of them, you can see the full list, their names, and email addresses.
Greyed out avatars are people who are not currently viewing the page but have access to it.
When you collaborate in real-time on the same content, you can see people's photos moving around, corresponding to the block they're reading or editing.
Each row in this menu represents a different person or group of people you can share the page with. The dropdown menus on the right let you set their level of access.Learn more about permissions here →
----
Copy linkcopies the page's unique URL to your clipboard so you can share it with whoever you want. Still, only people with access to the page can see it.
Invitelets you add people both inside or outside your workspace to a page using their email address.Learn more about sharing here →
Click the🕘clock icon to get an overview of all the revisions and comments made on the current page.
UnderPage notification settingsyou can change when you'd like to be notified.
You'll see all notifications aggregated across all the pages you follow in theInboxmenu in your sidebar.
This menu contains many options, including:
Lock page: Turn this on to prevent any edits from being made. This is good for preventing accidental edits on very important pages.
----
Lock database: This option is only available for full-page databases. When you turn this on, people can still enter data, but they can’t change views or properties.
Customize page: Toggle the visibility of backlink and page comment sections.
Move to: This opens up a menu where you can choose any other workspace or page to move the current page into.

----
One last reminder that a workspace operates slightly differently if you're using it with a team than if you're using it on your own:
Personal workspaces default to keeping pages private unless they're explicitly shared.
Sidebar organization under ateamspaceis also viewable by all members. The page arrangement will look the same to everyone, although individuals can toggle different pages open or closed without affecting everyone's view.
On Notion's Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, there are members and admins with different levels of permission.Learn more about sharing and permissions here →
Can I switch between workspaces that are associated with different email addresses?
----
To add your workspaces from another email account, use theAdd another accountbutton in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account.More on this here →
I clicked the Create or Join Workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?
You can only join a workspace via theCreate or Join Workspacebutton if that workspace has theAllowed Email Domainssetting enabled, which lets users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.
To join a workspace, you'll need to ask an admin from that workspace to send you an invite.
----
To add your workspaces from another email account, use theAdd another accountbutton in the workspace switcher at the top left of your Notion window, and follow the steps to login to your other account.More on this here →
My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?
The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, aTeamspacessection appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and thePrivatesection is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.
When I subscribe to a Plus Plan, does it cover all my workspaces?
----
Paid plans only apply to one workspace, and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.
How can I migrate all my Notion content to a different workspace?
Note:Any migrated content will be duplicated to the new workspace and these pages sometimes have issues. For more information,click here.
----
To move your content from one workspace to another associated with the same account, click•••next to each of the top-level pages in your sidebar (or right click) and selectMove to.At the bottom of the move menu, you’ll see a drop down to select a different workspace.
When you move top-level pages, all their sub-pages go with them. They'll appear in thePrivatesection but can be moved wherever you want to put them.
What if I accidentally deleted something permanently? Any way to get it back?
If you accidentally delete a page, a workspace, or even your entire account, we can help! Accidents happen 😅 Just send us a message in the app by clicking?at the bottom left on desktop (or in your sidebar on mobile). Or email us atteam@makenotion.com.

We keep backups of our database, which allows us to restore a snapshot of your content in the past 30 days if you need it.
How do I log out of my Notion account?
Click on your current workspace's name at the very top left of your sidebar. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see the option toLog outnext to your email address.

Invoices & proration
To see all of the invoices you've received and paid for a workspace:
Go toSettings & membersin your left-hand sidebar.
ClickBillingin the sidebar of that window.
UnderInvoices, you'll see all of your current and past invoices dated accordingly.
If you haven't paid it yet, it will sayDue.
If you have paid the invoice, it will sayPaid.
If you had enough credit earned to cover the invoice, it will sayCredited. (You'll see your balance of credits remaining in parentheses.)
If a payment attempt was made but failed, the invoice will be labeledFailed.
Click onView invoiceto see a copy of your invoice and itemized breakdown.
Look at Workspace balance for the total of your next invoice.
----
Note:All valid billing credits will expire six months from the date they are generated. Once credits have expired, they can’t be reinstated.
We know we've used the word 'prorate' a lot, so we want to provide some more context.We adjust the amount we bill you so you only pay for what you're getting and for the time you're getting it. So:
For new members, you only pay for the fraction of the billing interval that they belonged to your workspace. The same goes for removed members.
If you switch from monthly to yearly billing, you get the discount for the amount of time left in your monthly billing interval.
----
Our system does a lot of multiplication to get to these numbers. It takes the percentage of time left in your billing interval when you made a change, and multiplies that by the charges for the new members you added (as one example).
Because you pay at the beginning of every billing interval, these charges (or credits) for changes made in the middle need to be added retroactively to your next invoice.
Phew! Hope that helps!
Regardless of whether you're paying yearly or monthly, our system reviews how many members you've added on a monthly basis.
For each member, we look at when during your billing interval they were added. You do not get charged for the time they didn't belong to your workspace.
----
You're billed retroactively on a prorated basis, depending on the time they did belong to your workspace. Here's how this works:
On a monthly plan,this means you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but it will also include retroactive prorated charges for the member(s) you added during your last billing interval. Here's an example of this in action:
On a yearly plan, this means you'll receive an invoice at the next month mark (on the same calendar date you bought your plan) that will include two things:
The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.
----
Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace.
Here's an example of what this might look like for a whole company or large team:
Note:If you’re on a Plus, Business or Enterprise Plan, every new member that’s added or joins represents an additional charge, starting immediately.
Same as adding members, our system will register that you've removed members on a monthly basis.
For each member removed, we'll credit you a prorated amount for the time they did not belong to your workspace. You'll only be charged for the time they did belong.
These credits will be immediately applied to the amount due in your next billing interval.
----
On a monthly plan, this means you'll see credits applied to the amount due on your regular monthly invoice.
On a yearly plan, this means we'll store credits for you until your next renewal date, and they'll be applied then. You'll see that on your next annual invoice.
There are several reasons this happens. Usually, this is because some change was made to your plan, number of members, or billing interval in between invoices (or maybe all three!), and we prorated the amount due accordingly:
You've added or subtracted members from your workspace during the billing interval.
For every new member who joins on your yearly Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, you'll be charged for an entire year of Notion for them.
----
You changed your billing interval from monthly to annual, or vice versa.
You upgraded your plan during a billing interval. In this case, we charge you your previous rate for the time you had that plan, and your new rate for the time you had your upgraded plan. It's a blend of both!
We've credited your account because you've removed members from your workspace.
You've applied earned credits (like from referrals) to your balance due.

Integrate Jira
Notion’s integration with Jira allows you to do a few different things. You can insert Jira links into Notion pages to quickly access or preview them, or you can sync your Jira projects and issues to Notion databases so you can track all of your work in one place. Read on to learn about the different forms of the integration and how you can set them up.
Go toSettings & memberson the top of the sidebar.
Click onImportand findJira(for link previews and link mentions).
TheJiraintegration is used for link previews and link mentions.
You can also selectJira Sync, another integration which syncs Jira projects and issues in Notion.Click herefor more info about Jira Sync.
ClickConnectand go through the authentication flow.
----
Note:Link previews only work with Jira Software.
Paste a Jira link into Notion.
Select Preview in the menu that appears to see a live preview of the project or issue.
If you haven’t already connected Jira with Notion, you’ll be prompted to when you paste your Jira link into Notion. Learn more about link previews inthis article →
Note:Link mentions work with all Jira Cloud products.
Paste a Jira link into Notion.
Select Mention in the menu that appears to easily reference a project or issue in your documents.
If you haven’t already connected Jira with Notion, you’ll be prompted to when you paste your Jira link into Notion. Learn more about link mentions inthis article →
----
The Jira Sync integration connects Jira projects with Notion through the use of an Admin API token (instead of a user token), allowing for a more unified experience.
Now you can take full advantage of Notion's features includingautomations,rollups, and Notion AI. UseNotion Q&Ato quickly answer questions about your Jira projects.
Note:
A workspace owner must set up Jira Sync first, then all members can use it.
You can create a Jira service account to set up Jira Sync — just make sure the service account has access to any projects you want to sync into Notion beforehand.
----
Synced databases work with Jira Cloud products (Jira Software, Jira Product Discovery, Jira Work Management, and Jira Service Management), with support for Jira Server coming soon!
Jira Sync displays your Jira projects and issues as Notion projects and issues databases. This setup allows you to see and track multiple projects using a variety of helpfulviews, filters, and sorts.
You can even use identity mapping to connect Jira identities to Notion profiles so that you can see who’s responsible for what in synced Notion databases.
🟡 Note:Onlyworkspace owners can set up Jira Sync, by using aJira Admin token. After that, any member can utilize the connection.
----
Although any member can create syncs, you'll need to be aworkspace ownerto set up Jira Sync initially.
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Import→Jira Sync.
You can also paste in a Jira database link or use the slash command/jira sync.
If you’ve previously created a Jira synced database in Notion, open that database and selectImprove your Jira syncat the top.
In the window that appears, selectGet started.
Enter your Jira admin email, Jira site URL, andAPI token, then selectNext.
Note:Members need to authenticate their Jira toadd or remove projects. They can only add projects they have access to in Jira.
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Import→Jira Sync.
----
You can also paste in a Jira database link or use the slash command/jira sync.
In the window that appears, selectGet started.
Select the Jira site you want to sync from.
SelectCreate a new syncor select any existing sync you might already have in the dropdown menu. If you choose an existing sync, your projects will be added to your existing synced projects and issues databases.
In the database that opens, you’ll need to connect your Jira account (unless you’re the workspace owner who set up the integration). From here, select the data you want to sync into Notion. FirstSelect projects to sync, thenSelect properties to sync.
----
Repeat the steps above if you’d like to set up another Jira sync for another site, teamspace, or workspace. Comments and attachments (up to five files per issue, no larger than 1MB) will also be synced.
You canapply permissionsto the database page to make the synced databases accessible to your collaborators.
Note:Jira synced databases will inherit Notion permissions.Members can access synced databases on any pages they have permission to view.
If a member adds a private Jira project to a Notion page, anyone with Notion page access will see it.
Synced databases will include people properties! Now, you can use identity mapping to connect third party JIRA identities to your team's Notion profiles. To do this:
----
Confirm you have implemented Jira Cloud.
If you’re an admin, go to Jira, click onJira System settings,and change the user email visibility fromHiddentoPublicinside your organization. If you're an individual user, you’ll need to manually change their settings by changing the email visibility option. Follow the instructionshere →

To delete a Jira synced database, select•••at the top of your synced database →Delete Table.
----
Your Jira projects will be synced into a Notion projects database. Your projects will be intelligently mapped to their corresponding Jira issues in a related, synced issues database in Notion. This database will come with pre-populated default database views to help you get started more quickly:
Active (table view): This view shows the projects you’ve synced whose status is in progress. In other words, this view doesn’t show projects that have already been completed. There are also preset filters for owner and date to make searching easier.
Timeline view: This view displays project name, status, owner, and completion rate. There are also preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.
----
Board view: This view shows your projects grouped by status (Planning,In Progress). You can customize the statuses that show in the view in the•••menu. Projects are sorted by descending priority.
All (table view): This view displays all of your synced projects. There are preset filters for status, owner, and date to make searching easier.
Your Jira issues (epic, bug, task, subtask, story) will be synced into a Notion issues database, the equivalent of a Notiontasks database. As with the synced projects database, there will be default database views created for you to help you get started more quickly:
----
By Project (table view): This view shows all tasks, grouped by project. There are pre-set filters for status, assignee, date, and project to make searching easier.
By Epic (table view): This view shows your Jira stories, tasks, and bugs grouped by Epic.
Board view: This view is grouped by status and sorted by descending priority. The pre-set properties that will be displayed are assignee, project, priority, and sub-tasks,
All tasks (table view): This view displays all your synced tasks. The pre-set properties that will be displayed are task name, status, assignee, date, priority, tags, and project
Mine (table view): This view is filtered to only show tasks that are assigned to you. There are pre-set filters for status, date, and project.
----
It should only take a few minutes for the initial sync to complete, but depending on the size of your Jira projects and issues, this could take up to a few hours.
Some issue fields or properties may not sync, such as rich text in property and nested multi-selects.
Once the initial sync has been set up, updates to properties should be reflected in Notion in real time. If you create new properties, it could take up to 12 hours for those changes to sync.
You can’t manually sync Jira with Notion — syncs happen in response to updates made in Jira.
At this time, updates from Jira will sync to your Notion database in real time — not the other way around. Any changes you make in your Notion database won’t sync to Jira.
----

Link previews
Link previews allow you to see live, synced visualizations of links directly in Notion.This is currently supported for several platforms:
GitHub
Jira
Slack
Asana
Trello
Linear
Zoom
Figma
Adobe XD
Dropbox
OneDrive & Sharepoint
Pitch
Amplitude
Hex
GRID
GitLab
Box
Lucid (Lucidspark and Lucidchart)
Whimsical
ClickUp
Zendesk
Copy a link from any of the supported platforms. Paste it into Notion and selectPaste as: Preview.
The first time that you paste a link from one of these platforms, you'll see a button that asks you to connect to the app.
Once you click the button to connect, you'll be redirected to a browser window. Here, the app will ask for authentication and permission to display content in Notion.
----
When you've authenticated with the app, you'll see a detailed preview of the linked content. This preview updates as changes are made to any relevant fields.
Note:Once you've authenticated a connected app, anyone who can view your Notion page will be able to see corresponding content that you've pasted as a link preview.
In some cases, information will be abstracted (e.g., channel names from Slack private channels and DMs).
In addition to previews, you can also paste links from these platforms as mentions. These provide a more condensed visualization of the content in the link.
Copy a link from any of the supported platforms. Paste it into Notion and you'll see the option toPaste as: Mention.
----
Similarly to previews, you'll have to authenticate the app the very first time you paste a corresponding link in Notion. Click the button to open the authentication window and grant the necessary permissions. Afterward, you'll see the link mention pop up!
Tip:You can paste links as mentions directly inline, next to other text!
I’m receiving an “Access denied” or “Content not found” error in my link preview.
There are two possible reasons for this:
You may not have authenticated with the account that has access. You can connect multiple accounts either throughSettings & Members→My connected apps, or the error drop down.
----
Your organization may have limited access to content via 3rd party integrations or IP addresses. Please confirm with your workspace or organization administrator and ask to have Notion’s integration approved if this is the case. Here are instructions for specific integrations:GitHub,Jira,Slack,Asana,Trello.
Can I add more than one login for a link preview integration?
You can! You can do so viaSettings & Members→My connected apps. For the desired integration, select “Connect another account”.
Note: Some applications do not support multi-account login in the browser (e.g. GitHub), so you might need to logout of whichever account is currently logged in on your browser to be prompted to login with a different account.
----
We’ll determine which of your accounts to use to preview given resources and show an error if none of them are successful.
I’m receiving a general  “Can’t load preview” error in my link preview.
Run through these steps to try to resolve.
Confirm you’ve authenticated with the correct account for the resource.
Confirm no access restrictions for your organization.
Delete your integration in Notion via theMy connected appssettings. You may also want to revoke the integration the corresponding platform:GitHub,Jira,Slack,Asana,Trello.
Try to unfurl again.

Synced databases
Synced databases allow you to sync data from other platforms as Notion databases. Syncs are continuous but only go one direction, meaning that data changes will need to happen on the original platform in order for updates to appear in Notion.
Platforms include:
Jiraboards and projects
GitHubPRs and issues
Asanaprojects and tasks
GitLabmerge requests and issues
More apps will be supported in the future!
Learn how you can use Synced Databases to break team silos:

GitHub
In GitHub, copy the link to a PR or issue.
----
Paste the link into Notion and selectPaste as database.
If you haven't already, you will be prompted to sign in and connect Notion with your GitHub account.
The synced database will created in atable view, with all GitHub properties automatically added.
The database will begin populating automatically and will continue to sync if you navigate away from the page.
Asana
In Asana, copy the link to a project.
Paste the link into Notion and selectPaste as database.
If you haven't already, you will be prompted to sign in and connect Notion with your Asana account.
The synced database will created in atable view, with all Asana properties automatically added.
----
The database will begin populating automatically and will continue to sync if you navigate away from the page.
Note:At this time, only updates from Jira and GitHub will sync to your Notion database — not the other way around. Any changes you make in your Notion database won’t sync to Jira or GitHub.
You can add any Notion property to a synced database. There are two things to know when adding an additional Notion property onto a synced database.
If a property is deleted on the third-party app (i.e. you delete a task in Jira), the associated synced database row and all properties will be deleted. They will be accessible in the trash to view what was deleted, but cannot be restored.
----
If an added Notion property shares a name with any third-party properties (Jira, GitHub, GitLab, or Asana), that property will not sync.
Synced databases will include people properties! Now, you can use identity mapping to connect third party GitHub and JIRA identities to your team's Notion profiles.
Jira
Read ourarticleon our Jira integration for more details.
GitHub
Navigate to yourGitHub email settingsand ensure that the box for "Keep my email addresses" private is not checked on.
Then in your GitHub profile:https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME_HERE}, edit your profile to add your Notion email address.
This enables your identity to be mapped for synced databases, only for workspaces you are a member of.

Once you've set your own workspace domain, it will be displayed at the start of any public page URLs, such asacme.notion.site. The uniqueacme.notion.siteURL isonly used for publicly shared pagesfrom within your workspace. Internally, you will still see the URL asnotion.so/acme.
Note:
Notion reserves the right to reclaim a notion.site domain at any time, at its sole discretion.
----
Once you set a custom notion.site domain, you’ll need to continue to actively use your Notion workspace in order to maintain it. If you don’t, you might lose the domain.
If you switch to a new custom notion.site domain, any existing links starting with the previous domain (previousdomain.notion.site) will no longer work! You'll need to re-share new links containing the new domain.
Note:The following is only available on paid plans.
----
Workspace owners on paid plans can connect their existing custom domains with Notion Sites by purchasing the custom domain add-on. Notion doesn’t sell custom domains or replace your current domain provider — the add-on allows you to use Notion Sites with a custom domain you already own. Learn more about this featurehere →
When you use a custom domain with Notion Sites, you’ll also have the option to remove any Notion branding for that custom domain. Learn more about customizing your Sites inthis article →
Note:The following is only available on paid plans.
To update the Homepage for a domain:
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Sites.
Find the domain whose Homepage you want to update, then underHomepage:

If you don’t already have a Homepage assigned, selectSelect a page, then search for and select a page. Only pages that have already beenpublishedas a Notion Site under this domain will appear in this search.
If you already have a Homepage assigned but want to change it, select the pencil icon, then search for and select a page.
If you already have a Homepage assigned but want to clear it, selectX.
To update, validate, or delete a domain:
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Sites.
Next to your desired domain, select•••.
From here, select:
----
Updateto change yournotion.sitedomain name. Any changes will apply to all of your live Notion Sites associated with this domain. Enter a new name and selectSave changes. If you’re trying to update your custom domain name, you’ll have to delete the existing one and add a custom domain again, using the correct name.
Deleteto remove your domain. If any Notion Sites have been published to the domain you’re trying to delete, you’ll be asked to unpublish those Sites before proceeding.
Validateto verify your custom domain.
Note:
If your domain has a flag next to it in your Sites settings, you won’t be able to delete it. This is because it’s the default domain of your workspace that was created when your workspace was created.
----
When you delete a custom domain, you'll still be able to use it with Notion Sites until the end of your current billing cycle. After that time, you will no longer be charged for that custom domain.
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Sites→All published sitesto see which of your Notion pages have been published as Notion Sites. From here, you can:

Managed users
Enterprise workspace owners have the ability to manage all the users within their organization. A managed user is any user with an account created with the organization's verified email domain.
Note:In order to use this feature, you will need to be:
On an Enterprise Plan
A workspace owner
Workspace has averified domain
There are many ways in which workspace owners can manage users with their domain. To access these settings, click onSettings & membersand navigate toIdentity & provisioning.
Workspace owners can use these settings to apply more granularity to how their managed users work in Notion.
Allow users to change account information: Let users change their
preferred name, email address, and profile photo.
----
External workspace access: Decide whether managed users can join workspaces that aren't owned by your organization.
Prevent managed users support access: Control which users can allow Notion support to remote login for troubleshooting. For more information on what Notion support can view, see our terms of service.
Session duration: Set how long a user can be logged in before they will be required to re-authenticate. This applies to all devices a user is logged in on.
For managed users on the Enterprise plan, Notion has a default session duration of 180 days.However, workspace owners can customize their session duration from 1 hour to 180 days.
Log out all users: Force all users to log out.
----
Reset passwords for all users: Force all users to reset their passwords.
Enterprise workspace owners have access to a handy dashboard that gives them an overview of all users in their verified domain.
In this dashboard, workspace owners can:
Search and filter all users using the workspace's verified domains
Edit managed user's profile information
View which external workspaces managed users are a part of
Remove managed users from external workspaces
The dashboard displays user details such as name, email address, a list of workspaces they have access to, last active date, and the state of their 2-step authentication.
To access the managed users dashboard:
Click onSettings & membersand navigate toIdentity & provisioning.
----
UnderUser management, findUser dashboardand clickView dashboard.
From this dashboard, workspace owners can search for users by name, email, or ID. Additionally, they can filter by workspace and 2-step verification method.
Note:Suspended users remain as billable seats to whatever workspaces they are a part of.
All of their content and comments continue to show as normal, any integrations they set up continue to work, but their profile photo will appear as a gray crossed out silhouette.
On a specific user's profile, workspace owners can:
Suspend the user
Delete the user
Change the user's name and email address.The new email must belong to the verified domain.
Log the user out
Reset the user's password
Remove the user from external workspaces
----
Will changes to managed user accounts made by the workspace admins be tracked?
Yes, all changes made by a workspace owner to a managed user’s account will be logged in the audit log.
If a password is reset or a user is removed from a workspace, they will receive an email notification.
Will users in my workspace know that their account is being managed by the workspace admin?
Yes, users will see a badge in theirMy accountsettings.
If my workspace is using SCIM, can I still make changes to managed user accounts through Notion?
----
Updating managed user profile information from this new dashboard isnot recommendedif the Enterprise workspace is using the SCIM API directly or through an Identity Provider (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace) to programmatically manage workspace members.
If the workspace is using SCIM, then changes made from the Notion Settings UI will be replaced when the next SCIM API request syncs up.
My workspace has verified several domains. Will I see all managed users for all of our domains together in the dashboard?
Yes, you will see all your managed users (from multiple verified domains) together in the dashboard.
What happens if a user is suspended?
Suspended users remain as billable seats to whatever workspaces they are a part of.
----
All of their content and comments continue to show as normal, any integrations they set up continue to work, but their profile photo will appear as a gray crossed out silhouette.
Other users can still share pages with the suspended user, @-mention them, and add them to workspaces or teamspaces. The suspended users won’t be able login, receive any notifications, or access any of these resources. They’ll see them if/when they’re unsuspended.
What happens if a user is deleted?
All public or shared content created by the deleted user remains, but attributions and @-mentions change toDeleted User.
----
Any private or shared pages where no remaining users have full access will be deleted. Deletions are permanent, with a 30-day grace period to cancel and restore.
If the account may be needed in the future, it is recommended to suspend instead of delete. Deleted users do not contribute to the billable seat count of the workspace.

Math equations
Notion uses the KaTeXlibraryto render math equations, which supports a large subset of LaTeX functions.
Click the+that appears to the left when you hover over a new line. Scroll down and chooseBlock equationin the dropdown. Alternatively, type/mathand press enter.
With the new equation block in place, click inside it to type or paste your equation, or usecmd/ctrl+enter/return.
Just like you can format text in Notion asbold, strikethrough, orcode notation, you can also format your text as a math equation, like this quadratic formula:
There are a few different ways to add math equations inline, and all are keyboard friendly.
With text shortcuts:
----
Type two dollar signs, followed by your equation. When you close your formula with two more dollar signs, it will turn into an equation.
With the equation input:
To open the equation input, use the keyboard shortcutctrl/cmd+shift+E.
Type your equation into the input, and pressenter.
With the formatting menu:
Highlight an equation in your paragraph.
Click the√xbutton in the formatting menu that appears, or use the keyboard shortcutctrl/cmd+shift+E. Your selected text should turn into an equation.
You can edit an existing equation by clicking on it. This will open the equation input, and any changes you make to the equation will reflect live on your page.
----
You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate to an equation. The equation input will open when your cursor passes over the equation, and the equation input will close if you continue pressing the arrow key in the same direction.
Notion supports the full scope of symbols and operations within the \KaTeX language. For a full list of supported functions, please visit the links below:
Supported Functions · KaTeX
Support Table · KaTeX
Note:KaTeX spans most, but not all mathematical notation supported by LaTeX. If your equation isn't rendering correctly in Notion, please visit the links above to see if that function is supported.
I don't know LaTeX but want to use Notion's equations. How can I get started?
----
It's easy to get started using LaTeX for homework, class notes, or lab reports. Basic arithmetic and variable names are valid in LaTeX already.
If you just need to look up specific symbols,Detexifyis a great resource that allows you to draw the symbol and look up the corresponding LaTeX code.
To learn more powerful LaTeX, Overleafdocumentationis a great place to learn the basics:
Mathematical expressions
Subscripts and superscripts
Brackets and Parentheses
Matrices
Fractions and Binomials
Aligning Equations
Operators
Spacing in math mode
Integrals, sums and limits
Display style in math mode
List of Greek letters and math symbols
Mathematical fonts
----
Note that Overleaf is a full-featured LaTeX editor, so not everything in the documentation is supported in Notion. If in doubt, you can always check this list ofSupported Functionsor alphabetizedSupport Tableto determine which functions are supported.
Why can't I render a specific equation? What formulas/libraries do you support? Can you add support for a formula or library I want to use?
Notion uses theKaTeXlibrary to render equations. KaTeX supports a large subset of LaTeX, documented on their list ofSupported Functionsand alphabetized in thisSupport Table. To request support for new functions or environments, you can open an issue on theKaTeX GitHub project.
I'm trying to use the align environment and it's not working!
----
From theCommon Issuespage of the KaTeX documentation:
"KaTeX does not support thealignenvironment because LaTeX doesn't supportalignin math mode. Thealignedenvironment offers the same functionality but in math mode, so use that instead."
Can I use inline equations for superscript and subscript?
It's possible to use inline equations for superscript and subscript, but it does mean that the text will be an equation, in "equation font."
Use^to designate superscript, for example:x^2
Use_to designate subscript, for example:H_2O
If there are multiple characters that you want to include in superscript or subscript, wrap them in curly brackets. For example:23^{rd}
What happens when I copy/paste inline LaTeX?
It will give you the source code.
----
How do I use Notion for chemistry?
Notion supports the\\ceand\\puchemical equation macros from themhchemextension. These shortcuts allow you to typeset beautiful chemical and mathematical equations quickly and easily.
How do I convert between inline and block equations?
If you have a block containing an inline equation, you can use the "Turn into" menu to make it a block equation.
Notion is fully equipped with keyboard and Markdown shortcuts so you can do everything you need without ever touching your mouse ⌨️

Import from Monday.com
TheMonday.comimporter helps you bring your Monday.com boards and all the data within them into Notion.
Note:At this time, ourMonday.comimporter only supports Projects and Tasks type boards. Check or change your board type in Monday.com by following the instructions to customize item terminology inthis article.
If you import a task board and related projects, we’ll import the tasks into the task database and create a project in the project database using the task board’s name.
If you import a task board without any related projects, we’ll important the tasks into the task database and create a project in the project database using the task board’s name.
----
Every teamspace in Notion gets one project and one task database per import, so if you have multiple projects within one teamspace, all of those projects will go into the same database, unless imported in batches. As a workaround, you can import any additional projects into a separate teamspace and move them manually afterwards, or import your account in batches so that you can bring more projects and task databases to the same teamspaces each time.
The importer will also import all information about task owners and due dates into your Notion database.
----
Note that an assignee inMonday.commust be namedOwner,Assignee, orPersonin order for that information to properly appear in Notion as an assignee. Any project or task board should only have one column to indicate an assignee.
Imports can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours depending on size. You’ll receive an email notification once your import is complete.
There’s no limit to how many tasks you can import, but for the best experience, we recommend importing 10,000 tasks per teamspace, per import.
The importer won’t import documents. Instead, we’ll display the correspondingMonday.comdocument link in Notion.
You can import tasks from multiple workspaces, but you’re limited to importing one workspace at a time.
----
The import is a one-time event; any future changes you make inMonday.comwon’t automatically reflect in Notion.
At this time, you can’t preview an import beforehand.
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Import→Monday.com.
Enter your email and API token, which you can find using the instructionshere. SelectAuthenticatewhen you’re done.
Select yourMonday.comworkspace in the dropdown that appears.You can only import one workspace at a time.

There are several ways to create new pages using Notion's sidebar:
On hover, you'll see a+sign appear next to every teamspace name.
Click to add a page within that teamspace.
----
If you don't see this, then a teamspace owner has disabled editing of the teamspace sidebar. You'll need to contact that teamspace owner to change this setting.
You'll also see a+sign next to thePrivatesection. Click to add a new page that only you can access.
There's also a📝button at the top of your sidebar.
This creates a new page in preview mode, letting you start a new page and then choose where to put it in your workspace (or one of your other workspaces) using a dropdown menu. If you don't choose, it will default to yourPrivatesection.
Lastly, if you hover over any existing page in your sidebar, you'll see a+appear. Click that to add a page nested inside that page.
----
It doesn't take much to move pages around your sidebar. Just drag and drop!
A few things we'll point out:
Nest pages by dragging one into another. You'll see the selected page highlight blue.
You can also drag pages out of pages they were once nested inside.
We'll say it one more time here: If you drag a page from a shared section (TeamspacesorShared) intoPrivate, other folks will lose access. So make sure that's what you want to do.
Your sidebar is elastic — configure it however is most helpful for you.
Just click and drag the right edge to resize it.
Click the<<that appears on hover to collapse your sidebar completely. It'll slide back out when you hover over the left-hand edge of the window.
----
You can reopen it by clicking the☰button at the top left.
You can also collapse or hide theFavorites,Workspace,Shared, orPrivatesections of your sidebar. Just click on those headings to hide or reveal them.
There are two ways to delete pages from your sidebar:
Click on the•••icon that appears when you hover over a page and selectDelete.
Drag a page from your workspace into theTrash. This will delete all the sub-pages nested within that page, including database items.
How do I log out of my Notion account?
Click on your current workspace's name at the very top left of your sidebar. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see the option toLog outnext to your email address.
My sidebar doesn't have any sections. How do I turn those on?
----
The sidebar sections reflect the sharing settings of your account. If you have more than one person in your workspace, aTeamspacessection appears in the sidebar for your collaborative work with that person, and thePrivatesection is there for your personal pages that are only visible to you.
Can I rename the sidebar sections or add my own custom sections?
Not at the moment, unfortunately 😓 If your sidebar is feeling cluttered, you can always consolidate some of your pages under more top-level pages.
----
When you're brand new to Notion, it's best to keep it simple and start with just one workspace. But as you start using Notion for more things, and with more groups of people, you can keep different kinds of content separate by using multiple workspaces 🏘

Organize information with databases
Databases are a powerful Notion feature that can unlock your toolmaking potential. Create databases, learn about layout types, and build databases for teams.
Databases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, discuss the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃
Here, we'll introduce you to the different customization options and layouts that exist once you have a database set up in your workspace.
Timeline is a type of Notion database that’s way more than a Gantt chart. It gives you complete flexibility to scope projects, adjust their timelines, and customize your workflow.
----
Tables are Notion's most traditional database view, but our tables are a lot more powerful than a grid with some rows and columns! Open each row as its own Notion page, or visualize in other database views.
Galleries are Notion's most visual database view. Use them to showcase beautiful photos for mood boards, team directories, vacation photos and more.
Lists are Notion's most minimalist database view. All the power of a database, but without the visual clutter. Use them for meeting notes, journal entries, process documentation and more!
One of Notion's most powerful features, Boards are the best way to manage projects & tasks. Use them to group your databases by select, multiselect, and person properties.
----
Calendars are a great way to visualize dates from any database in Notion. Use them for your company's social media planning, or add a calendar view to your product management databases.
Instead of manually typing out the same structure and content for every new page, you can use database templates to automate your processes and save some time.
Linked databases let you include synced copies of the same content across different pages. Use them to include a filtered view of team tasks in your meeting notes, or create a dashboard of tasks assigned to you from different databases.
----
Managing tasks and projects in Notion just got a big upgrade. With new advanced database filters, you have even more control and customizability over your database views - make them as specific as you want for a more organized and efficient workflow.
Notion databases become even more powerful when you link them together. Link to a row from another database with a relation, or show a specific property from a related table with a rollup.

Connect work with relations
Two databases are related when an entry, or multiple entries, in one relates to an entry in another. Use relation properties to connect databases in Notion.
For example, projects and tasks are two separate databases in Notion
Rollups in Notion allow you to view data from a related database.
For example, “task completion” on projects is a rollup displaying the aggregate status property of related tasks.
To create a relation property, go to the three-dot database options menu, click "Properties," and then "Add a new property". Select "Relation" as the property type, and choose the database you want to relate to.

Create a project tracker
Projects are larger chunks of work (often encapsulating weeks or months) while tasks are things that need to be accomplished for the project to succeed.
Notion's Projects and tasks template can be customized to fit your organization's needs by adding additional levels of hierarchy — like objectives — to represent even larger bodies of work.
Open any page in “Projects” to start your project.
Fill out properties like owner, project dates, and priority.
The "About the project" section and a database of tasks are included by default in project pages created using Notion's templates
Consider using a synced block from your project plan to keep the “About the project” section up to date.

Docs and meetings
Docs and meetings serve as the living knowledge base of a company, capturing ongoing work and discussions. Your company only needs one of each database, stored in your general teamspace.
In Notion, docs are active work records like proposals and research reports, serving as a living knowledge base that captures ongoing work, discussions, and various aspects of a company. Properties to enhance docs include:
AI summary → provides a quick and concise understanding of a document's content, allowing team members to get up to speed on a topic or project quickly.
Status → to confirm the accuracy and currentness of the information within the document, acting as a trust signal for users.
----
Owner → helps increase visibility and provide a point of contact for any questions about the document.
Meetings are documented with notes that include agendas, transcripts, and action items from live conversations, providing a comprehensive record of discussions.
Docs and Meetings belong in your workspace’s “general” (or company-wide) teamspace.

Database views are the cornerstone of building in Notion, allowing you to visualize any knowledge stored in databases to precisely fit your needs.
You can create a linked view by typing/database, selecting the layout you want to start with, then selecting your data source.
Any changes made to the data in a linked view will be reflected in the original data source, while changes to the view itself only affect the page you're viewing the data on.
Examples of database views include a project plan with related docs and meetings, a Wiki page with FAQs from the related FAQ database, and a standup agenda that shows all of the tasks a team is working on in a given week.

Projects are a dynamic type of knowledge in a workspace. They serve as the synthesis of context from your documents and meetings with the day-to-day work happening across your team. Customize projects with:
Subtasks and dependencies →to break down your tasks into smaller subtasks and ensures tasks are completed in the right order.
Database automations →to set up automatic updates, slack notifications, and actions based on specific conditions.
----
Connected properties →let you track related files in associated, specialized tools — like Figma and Github.

Publishing Notion pages to the web
Publish a Notion page to the web by navigating to theSharemenu, selecting thePublishtab, and clicking thePublishbutton.
Configure basic settings in the publish menu, including setting up a custom domain, enabling SEO indexing, and setting link expirations.
Once published, the Notion page will have a public URL that can be shared with others, making it accessible to anyone on the web. You can change the domain in the “Settings” menu.
Any changes made to the Notion page will automatically reflect on the public version, ensuring the content is always up-to-date.

New: Q&A
Q&A surfaces answers immediately, so you can leverage all the information in your Notion workspace.
You can ask Q&A for anything! Try starting with these examples:
Search for mentions of a particular topic across the workspace —For example, asking Q&A to “find mentions of plans for new user education” which might surface training materials for employees.
Answer onboarding questions —Even the most robust onboarding page will lead to questions. Q&A is an onboarding buddy for your new hires to ask anything, from how to set up their 401k, to what to do when they get locked out of the office.
----
Get up to date with a meeting you missed— Couldn’t make yesterday’s standup? Ask Q&A to summarize what was discussed and find tasks assigned to you after the meeting.
Suggest explanations for results of a campaign— Seen unusually fast growth in one market? Q&A can help you make sense of results. Ask “why have we experienced such high organic growth in Korea?”. It can look at the results of marketing campaigns, paid ads, user research and client feedback that relates to Korea, and suggest possible explanations.

Relations and Rollups
Relationsin Notion allow you to establish a link between two different types of knowledge (aka databases), enabling you to view and access data from one database in the context of another.
Once two databases are related you can create arollup, which allows you to view additional properties from the related database.
Relations and rollups can be used to connect different types of information such as OKRs to Projects, documents to meeting notes, wikis to FAQs, or projects to teams.
Add a relation by adding a new property to your database, and selecting the database you’d like to create a link to.

Scale your team: Building teamspaces
Teamspaces are a useful solution to complicated permissions needs. In many ways, they function like Slack channels which can be customized depending on your company's working style and needs.
When creating a new teamspace, you select a permission settings:
Openmeans anyone can join.
In general we recommend defaulting havingOpenteamspaces, with some exceptions.
Closedmeans anyone can see the teamspace exists, but can only join with an invitation.
Closed teams are useful when you need some control over who can view team content.
Privatemeans only teamspace members will be able to see that it exists.
----
Private team spaces are helpful when a group is working on something sensitive that you need a degree or privacy or anonymity for.
Assignment
Create teamspaces for working groups (like marketing, sales, and engineering), as well as cross-functional, topic based groups (like SF office or employee resource groups). Keep company-wide information like benefits, mission, and yearly goals in a “general” team.

Scale your team: Permissions
The more content you create in Notion, the more you’ll need to consider who has access to what content. There are two rules that govern Notion’s permissions:
Permissions are granted and revoked on the page level but inherited from parent pages and teamspaces. TheSharemenu, in the top right of any page, can be seen as the single source of truth for permissions.
Teamspace owners can set up default permissions for teamspace owners, teamspace members, and workspace members who don’t belong to the teamspace. These default permissions will apply to every new page created in a teamspace.
Within a teamspace, groups can be given unique levels of access.
----
A top level page of a teamspace will default to the teamspace’s settings, but these settings can be changed. Child pages will inherit permissions from their parents.
If a user has two different access levels, the higher access will be applied. If they have full access via a group permission but only “Can view” access via teamspace permissions, they’ll be given full access.

Scaling your team: Advanced database properties
Advanced properties allow you to create more layers of organization, and since they’re largely automated, you’re able to better understand your database without any extra work. Here are three advanced properties you should know:
Relations:Link one database to another. With Relations you're able to click into a property and view a list of database items on a related database. Try relating specific tasks to bigger projects or docs mentioned in specific meeting notes.
Formulas:Perform calculations or trigger actions based on other properties in a database. Formulas are useful for simple operations — like calculating a number based on two other properties, or creating an upvote mechanism.

Scaling your team: Database templates
Database templates can help streamline process for everyone on your team. There are several common use cases for templates including:
Bug reports:Every time a team member files a bug, you can have them respond to a series of consistent questions to help the engineering team solve the issue.
Document types:Reduce the overhead of starting a new project by creating a template with everything you need.
Requests:Templates can help streamline requests with teams you work closely with.
When creating a template, here are things you might want to add:
Give your template an emoji so you can quickly visual identify specific documents.

Next set up teamspaces for the largest functional groups that make sense (Marketing, Engineering, etc.)
Consider whether teamspaces should be open, closed, or private.
Once they’re created, start adding people and giving them roles.
In this case, we might give the team leads the teamspace owner role.
Teamspace owners will have a different set of permissions than teamspace members, so we’ll want to decide which people should have that specific role.

Sharing your workspace
The Notion sidebar contains three sections — teamspaces, shared, and private, each with its own purpose and level of access.
Find knowledge in three ways:
Skim top-level pages → best for looking through a wiki or onboarding to a team.
Search → when you know the doc you’re looking for.
Q&A → when you have a question or want AI to synthesize an answer.
Content can move throughout your sidebar as you work on it. For example, draft a doc in private, share it with reviewers, then move it to the docs database.
Sharing in Notion is granular and can be managed with great detail, enabling users to control who sees what content.

Understanding the current state of the workspace
- Auditing a workspace in Notion involves understanding how a company organizes knowledge on the platform and taking note of existing teamspaces and their content.- Teampspaces in Notion are used to separate different types of content or workflows within a workspace and their implementation should be planned.- It's important to ensure workspace members have the correct level of administrative access, with workspace owner being the highest level of administrator privilege.- Settings can be adjusted to control who can create new teamspaces and who can edit top-level pages of teamspaces.- Communication with the company about changes being implemented is key.

Using data: Automations
If you find yourself doing the same task over and over, there’s probably an opportunity to automate it! Notion’s API makes it so updates in Notion databases can trigger actions in other apps- thanks to integrator tools like Zapier and Make.

When aTaskis created, add a ticket in Jira
When acontent requestis updated, send a message to a Slack channel
When anupdateis marked “published” send an email to your team’s alias

Using data: Embeds
Embeds are a great way to take any Notion page to the next level. Rather than having to access multiple tools, you can use embeds to keep a lot of useful information in a single place.
There are over 500 different embed types in Notion including Google Maps, CodePen, Loom, Miro, Whimsical, and more.
Adding an embed:
For most common embed types in Notion you can just paste the link of that resource on the web, and select the “Embed file” option.
An embed shows the full content of a webpage within Notion, while a link preview only shows a summary and thumbnail of the linked page.
Embeds are better for incorporating reference material or other webpages that provide key information you want visible in your Notion workspace.
----
Notion supports embeds for common services like YouTube, Google Drive, Trello, and more. You just paste the URL and it automatically imports as an embed.
Link previews save space but require clicking the link to access the full content of the webpage. They're better for supplementary or additional reading material.

What is artificial intelligence?
This course covers three main ideas that Notion AI enables: improving writing, increasing work efficiency, and generating new text.
Improving writing with AI — Notion AI can help with spelling and grammar mistakes, shorten paragraphs, clarify technical terms, and more.
Increasing work efficiency with AI —Notion AI can summarize and extract insights from various documents, such as research papers, product requirement docs, tech specs, or news articles.
Generating new text with AI — Notion AI can help with writer's block by brainstorming ideas and content drafts. Ask AI for anything, and continue asking follow up prompts until you’re satisfied with the output
How does artificial intelligence work?
----
The computer finds patterns in a large set of data called training data to make a model.
The computer tests the model by asking a question it already knows the answer to and analyzing how accurate its answer is, using test data.
With more inputs and training data, it learns and improves the model over time.
Read more about how artificial intelligence works, as well as its current limitations,here.

Wikis and FAQs
Unlike docs and meetings, every team can have its own Wiki and FAQ databases housed in its teamspace. Your general teamspace will probably a have company-wide wiki too.
Wikis are places where employees can find information on processes, policies, and more. These pages typically have a longer shelf life than docs or meetings. Two key properties live on Wikis:
Owner → identifies the person who is responsible for the content of the page. This person is usually the best source of additional information or details about the page's content.
----
Verification → shows a team member that the information they're reading is up to date. When the verification expires, the page owners will receive a notification that it's time to re-verify or update the page content.
FAQs are another category of knowledge for miscellaneous information that encourage documentation and enhance discoverability of Wiki content.
FAQs can be related to wiki pages to provide context when team members ask a question.

Notion AI
By adding Notion AI to your Notion plan, you and everyone in your workspace can work faster and write better. Notion certainly isn’t the only AI-powered tool out there. But here’s what makes Notion AI special:
Artificial intelligence becomes more useful when it’s integrated across the place where you’re already doing your work, storing notes and docs, and collaborating with others. No need to switch back and forth between your notes and a separate AI-powered tool.
Compared to other tools, Notion has a unique and highly flexible drag-and-drop text editor, where any AI-generated content can be easily rearranged and transformed. Over time, Notion AI will be able to take advantage of even more Notion features.
----
Today, Notion AI has many uses across your notes and docs. But Notion can do a lot more than just notes — we’ll continue to expand Notion AI’s capabilities to help with project management and your team knowledge base in the future. This is just the beginning!
Currently, we offer these features as part of Notion AI:
Writer and Autofill: You can use Notion AI to create and edit content.
Q&A: You can get quick answers to your questions based on information across your workspace.
At this time, you can’t purchase Notion AI for only part of your team. If you add Notion AI to your workspace, every member of the workspace will be able to use AI features, including workspace owners, membership admins, and members.
----
Guests will not be able to use AI features in your workspace.
If you have a Free Plan workspace, or if you have a Plus, Business, or Enterprise subscription with monthly billing, you can add Notion AI to your plan for $10 per member per month.
Regardless of what plan you're on, you can get a20% discount with annual billing.
If you pay for Notion annually, you’ll also be billed annually for Notion AI. If you are on a Free Plan or paying for Notion monthly, you’ll also be billed monthly for Notion AI.
If you add Notion AI to a Free Plan, your billing interval will begin on the day you sign up for Notion AI. You’ll be charged monthly on that date.
----
If you add Notion AI to your existing paid plan, you’ll pay a prorated amount for the remaining time left on your current billing cycle. On your next billing date, the AI add-on charge will be added to your regular billing cadence.
To ensure optimal performance and fair use across all Notion AI users, your access to AI features can be reduced depending on your usage.
Everyone can try Notion AI for free before purchasing the add-on subscription. The more members you have, the more complimentary AI responses you may get, with the maximum being 500 responses across your entire workspace. To see how many free AI responses are remaining, workspace owners can go toSettings & memberson desktop.
----
Once you've used all your complimentary AI responses, you will see a message that a Notion AI add-on subscription is necessary to continue using AI features. You’ll need to be a workspace owner, and on desktop, to add Notion AI to your plan.
Note:The AI add-on is not available for users on the iOS Personal Pro Plan. To purchase Notion AI, you'll need to cancel your in-app subscription and choose a new Notion plan. We recommend thePlusPlan, which allows for unlimited blocks for teams, 30-day page history, and up to 100 guests.Notion is not able to provide a refund for the remaining time on your in-app subscription, but you can reach out to Apple for assistance — just follow the instructionshere.
----
Every time you take an AI action (including creating new content, editing existing content, using AI blocks, adding an autofill property, asking a question, etc.) and receive a response from Notion AI, that counts as an AI response.
Anytime you clickTry again, that counts as an additional AI response.
Writer is most effective for streamlining your workflows. For example, it can summarize meeting notes or help you brainstorm for a project. We recommend that you always check the accuracy of content from Notion AI before relying on it for critical content.

Notion AI security & privacy practices
Notion AI is a collection of AI products and features, which currently includes*:
AI assistant:Boost your productivity with instant answers to your questions as well as help with generating written content and brainstorming, all by using information from across your Notion workspace and the web.
Autofill:Generate text across many pages in a database simultaneously by writing a custom prompt or selecting a pre-configured prompt.
Notion AI features appear seamlessly in your workspace but leverage technology from several AI Subprocessors to provide you with the service. Check out ourSubprocessor pagefor a complete list of our current Subprocessors, and learn more about how Notion uses AI inthis article.
----
*Notion AI will continue expanding to include more features over time.
Notion currently utilizes various large language models (LLMs) hosted by Notion as well as by organizations such as Anthropic and OpenAI. We continuously evaluate LLM providers and their models to provide the highest quality experience to our Notion AI users. Any third parties that process Customer Data will be published in ourSubprocessor page.
How do I subscribe to new Subprocessor notifications?
----
Customers may sign up to receive notification of new Subprocessors by e-mailingteam@makenotion.comwith the subject “Subscribe to New Subprocessors.” Once a customer has signed up to receive new Subprocessor notifications, Notion will provide that customer with notice of any new Subprocessors before authorizing the new Subprocessor to process Customer Data. For additional information, please see ourData Processing Addendum.
When you interact with the Notion AI to set up an autofill property, several steps occur in the background:
Notion receives a prompt from a user.
Data relevant to the prompt is sent to an AI LLM Subprocessor, which produces an output to send back to Notion.
----
Notion then processes the LLM’s output so that it adheres to the right format and language and displays the output to the user.
How is my data protected?
When sending data to our AI LLM Subprocessors, the data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or greater, and no Customer Data is used to train the model.
All our AI LLM Subprocessors retain data for only 30 days or fewer before deletion.
Only data the user has access to on the specific page where Autofill is used will be sent to AI LLM Subprocessors to generate the output, meaning that the generated outputs provided to the user will not incorporate any data to which the user did not already have access.
----
Notion AI is a personalized assistant powered by GPT-4. It can search across your workspace, create and edit content, and chat with you about any topic.
The AI assistant works in two key phases:
Creating embeddings.
Generating responses.
What are embeddings?
----
Embeddings are numerical representations of text or documents. These representations capture the meaning and context of the text in a multidimensional space, where similar topics have similar numerical representations. By using embeddings, vector search algorithms can efficiently compare and find similarities between different pieces of text or documents. In the case of Notion’s AI assistant feature, embeddings are created from workspace content to enable the system to provide accurate and relevant responses to user questions.
Here is an example of an embedding fromOpenAI:
[-0.02541878,-0.0104167685,-0.0015037002,...,-0.004155378,-0.00043069973,-0.01679479]
How are embeddings created?
----
For each page in your workspace, we generate an embedding by using an OpenAI zero-retention embeddings API.
Notion receives an embedding for each Notion page and stores it in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone), which ultimately is used to find that original block when it is relevant to providing a response to the user.
How are embeddings used to generate responses?
Notion receives a question from a user.
The request is passed to an LLM Subprocessor. If the request does not require searching the Notion workspace, the LLM will generate a response at this point and skip the rest of the process. If the user’s request requires searching their workspace, the LLM generates a search query most relevant for the user request.
----
The query is passed to a vector database, where a list pages is found based on relevance to the query.
Notion sends the query — and the pages identified by the vector database — to a Notion-hosted LLM where the pages are refined and ranked by relevance to the query.
The query, refined list of pages, and ranking of pages are processed by our LLM Subprocessors to generate a response that fulfills the user’s request.
Notion processes the output to adhere to the right format and language and displays the output to the user.
How are embeddings protected?
----
Despite embeddings only being a numerical representation of Customer Data, Notion still treats embeddings with the same level of security and privacy considerations as Customer Data. All our Customer Data commitments outlined in our Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Data Processing Agreements (DPA) apply to embeddings. View ourTerms and Privacy Pagefor more information.
We store embeddings with vector databases like Pinecone. These vector databases have been vetted by our security team as well as an external auditor to obtain their SOC2 Type II certification.
Yes, Notion AI honors existing permissions. The LLM used to generate AI responses for a user cannot see or use any information to which that user does not already have access.
----
Notion AI is designed to protect your Customer Data and prevent information leaks to other users of the service.
----
Prior to engaging any third-party Subprocessor or vendor, Notion evaluates their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices, and executes an agreement implementing its applicable security, privacy, and legal obligations. All Subprocessors are monitored and reviewed at least annually to ensure continued compliance with Notion’s security and privacy expectations. This includes reviewing documents such as attestation reports, penetration tests, and other artifacts based on the Subprocessor’s criticality and other risk factors. As part of the onboarding and ongoing reviews, technology security questionnaires are distributed to vendors and are required to be completed. Significant public security events are also assessed to protect the supply chain attack surface.
----
When we send your Customer Data to third parties, it is encrypted in-transit using TLS 1.2 or greater.
For more information about how Notion processes your data, please refer to ourData Processing Addendum.
By default, Notion and its AI Subprocessors do not use Customer Data to train any models. We specifically have contractual agreements in place with our AI Subprocessors that prohibit the use of Customer Data to train their models.
Your use of Notion AI does not grant Notion any right or license to your Customer Data to train our machine learning models.
----
Individual customer accounts are kept separate in our production environment. We do not mix or process data from different customers together during AI processing. This means we do not expose your data to other Notion customers.
Notion AISubprocessorshave data retention policies that allow Notion to meetour obligations to customers for the processing of data.
----
When using Notion AI assistant and Autofill, our LLM providers utilize zero data retention for Enterprise plan workspaces, so no data is stored with LLM providers. For all non-Enterprise plan workspaces, LLM providers only retain Customer Data for 30 days or fewer before deletion.Notion's AI assistant is additionally powered by OpenAI's embeddings. OpenAI does not retain any Customer Data through their embeddings service.
Embeddings stored in vector databases are deleted within 60 days from when the page or workspace is deleted.
----
If a user deletes a Notion page or Notion workspace, we can restore the content within 30 days. After 30 days, the data is deleted and unrecoverable. This includes any AI-generated data and embeddings. For more information about deleting or restoring your data, please refer tothis article.
Notion AI is included in the scope of Notion’s SOC 2 Type 2 report and ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating our commitment to various regulatory and industry standards.
Notion AI enables HIPAA compliance by utilizing LLM providers' zero-retention APIs and allows for the processing of protected health information (PHI).
----
Customers can trigger data loss prevention (DLP) alerts for sensitive content in their Notion workspace using third-party integration partners on our Enterprise plan. That will include content in an AI prompt and the content generated by AI. Learn more about our DLP integrationshere.
TheNotion AI Supplementary Termsapply to your usage of Notion AI. In addition, Notion’sContent & Use Policyapplies to any content on Notion, including content generated by Notion AI. Violating these terms can result in removal of your content or suspension of access to your workspace.
Notion does not claim ownership of your input or the generated output. This is addressed in theNotion AI Supplementary Termsin the "Input and Output" section:
----
You may provide input to be processed by Notion AI (“Input”), and receive output generated and returned by Notion AI based on the Input (“Output”). When you use Notion AI, Input and Output are your Customer Data.
You can also reference our standarddata protection practices.
With Notion AI connectors, you can use Notion as a single place to find the information you need — even if it lives outside your workspace 👣

Notion Calendar conferencing integrations & API
Did you know you can use Notion Calendar with Notion?Learn more here →
For the best experience with setting up conferencing integrations and adding conferencing links to events, use Notion Calendar on desktop or web.
Notion Calendar integrates with conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and many more. There are three types of conferencing integrations in Notion Calendar:
Default integrations: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.
----
Connected integrations: An integration you can set up by logging into a conferencing tool. New events you create on desktop or web will generate new links for this conference tool from within Notion Calendar. Zoom is an example of a connected integration that Notion Calendar supports.
Custom integrations: You can add a stable conferencing link for a conferencing tool of your choice by going toSettings→Conferencing→Conferencing providers→Add. You can give your integration a name. This conferencing tool will show up in the conferencing dropdown when you create events. Any stable links will work, but Notion Calendar can detect popular services, includingAround,BlueJeans,Doxy.me,Microsoft Teams,Skype,Webex, andWhereby.
----
Note:If an event contains conferencing links in both its description and conferencing field, you’ll be taken to the link from the event’s description when you join a meeting from Notion Calendar.
A default conferencing option allows you to automatically add conferencing to an event that has at least one other participant when you’re using Notion Calendar on desktop. To set Zoom as this default option, go toSettings→Conferencing→Default conferencing, then in the dropdown, selectZoom.
Connect your Zoom account
----
To connect your Zoom and Notion Calendar accounts, go toSettings→Conferencing. FindZoomand selectConfigure. When you’re redirected to your browser, make sure you’re logged in with the right Zoom account, then selectAuthorizeto give Notion Calendar access.
Notion Calendar asks only for theZoom permissionsthat we absolutely need to make sure the integration with Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to allow you to connect your account and add Zoom meetings to events.Learn more about our security practices here →
Passcode settings
----
If you’ve enabled the use of Personal Meeting IDs (PMIs) in yourZoom Profile Settings, Notion Calendar will use your configured stable PMI and passcode when adding a Zoom link to a meeting. If this setting is off in Zoom, Notion Calendar will protect your Zoom calls with a secure, one-time PIN and include it in the meeting for you and participants to join with a single click. Notion Calendar generates these PINs according to your Zoom admin'spasscode complexity requirements.
Disconnect your Zoom account
To stop using your Zoom account with Notion Calendar, go toSettings→Conferencing. Find Zoom and selectDisconnect.
----
If you remove Notion Calendar from your installed apps in Zoom App Marketplace, we will follow Zoom'sdeauthorization and data complianceguidelines.
Note:
If you’re having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the integration, have an admin sign intomarketplace.zoom.us, search for Notion Calendar, and turn onPre-approve.
Currently, when you join a meeting in the Zoom app from Notion Calendar, your video will be turned off by default.
If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account.
----
Because Notion Calendar is already connected to your Google account, you don’t need to do anything else to add Google Meet links to your meetings! Even if you’ve connected multiple Google accounts to Notion Calendar, Notion Calendar will make sure you’re joining meetings across your various calendars from the right Google account.
Note:If you don’t see Google Meet as a conferencing option in Notion Calendar, it might mean your Google Workspace doesn’t have Google Meet enabled. Reach out to an admin toturn on Meet video calling.

Optimize database load times & performance
We’re always working to improve your experience with Notion, and we appreciate your feedback and patience. If your databases aren’t feeling very fast when you use them, there are a few reasons why this might be happening, and a few ways you can make improvements.
Number of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.
Number of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.
Complex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.
----
If you have a large workspace, avoid having lots ofinline databases, like dashboards, in high-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup.
Try housing each database in its own page first. Once you’ve done that, if you’d like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can:
Type/linkedin that page and selectLinked view of a databaseto create alinked database.
Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!
----
When using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup.
Formulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate.
Databases that arefiltered and sortedonformulaandrollupproperties may take a bit longer to load.
----
Adding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.
If some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity.
We suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible. If that’s not an option for you, adding a filter on theCreated timeproperty to filter out old pages may significantly improve performance for very large databases.
Learn more about databases to make sure you're using them in the best way for your specific needs

Organize information with databases

A table is the classic database view, but tables in Notion are more than just rows and columns. Each row opens up into its own page, and can contain whatever properties you want 📊

Privacy practices
Notion maintains a comprehensive privacy compliance program and is committed to partnering with its customers and vendors on privacy compliance efforts. This page highlights some of the key aspects of our program.
At Notion,our team is dedicated to developing and implementing data privacy processes and safeguards that meet industry standards and best practices. We conduct ongoing training for our teams to ensure that they are up to speed with developments in legislation and essential privacy and security practices.
----
Every Notion employee and contractor signs up to non-disclosure terms to maintain the confidentiality and security of your data. Notion also holds any vendors that handle personal data to the same data management, security, and privacy practices and standards to which we hold ourselves.
Notion defines Customer Data as any data that a customer stores in the Notion services. This can include personal information.
Customer data does not include analytics data or Account Information, which we describe below. The terms of the NotionMSAand NotionDPAapply to your Customer Data.
Account information is the information that our customers provide to us so that we can create and administer their customer accounts.
----
For example, account information includes names, usernames, passwords, phone numbers, email addresses, Workspace metadata, support communications, billing information, and usage information associated with your Notion account.
The terms of the NotionPrivacy Policyapply to any personal information included in Account Information.
You own your Customer Data, including any content you submit or upload to the Notion Service.
You control your Customer Data. You determine what content and data will be uploaded to  Notion. Once Customer Data is uploaded you manage access to your workspace by allocating user logins to individuals.
----
You also control the administration of the Customer Data by managing you groups, permissions and the user credentials that are under your control.
The NotionPrivacy Policydescribes in detail how Notion collects and uses your account information.
If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at:
Notion Labs, Inc. 2300 Harrison Street San Francisco, CA 94110 United Statesprivacy@makenotion.com
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that governs the collection of and use of personal data of EU residents, and that allows data subjects to exercise control over their data.
----
As the GDPR is widely considered to be the most stringent global privacy standard, we have mapped our privacy program to the GDPR and other global privacy regulations.
The GDPR and other data protection legislation have two primary classifications related to the collection and processing of personal data: data controller and data processor.
A data controller determines the means and purposes for processing personal data, while a data processor is a party that processes data on behalf of the data controller.
----
Where our customer is a data controller or data processor, Notion is the data processor of personal data that our customer and their users upload to the Notion service. We process any such personal data at our customer’s direction and on our customer’s behalf. We conduct this processing in accordance with Notion’sData Processing Addendum.
We understand and adhere to the rules for international transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area and UK.
----
In order for our customers to be confident of Notion’s data transfer processes ourData Processing Addendumincorporates both the EU and UK Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). In response to the Schrems II ruling, our DPA lists the technical and organisational measures we employ to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place when we transfer personal data to countries outside of the EEA and UK.
For more information about our technical security measures, please see oursecurity page.
Notion understands and appreciates the importance of maintaining transfer impact assessments (TIA) as a supplementary measure and as a critical piece of your privacy compliance program.
----
To assist our customers in completing these assessments,we maintainTransfer Impact Assessment pagethat includes all of the information about Notion that you need to complete your TIA.
We work with certain companies and tool systems to provide our services to you. All of these companies have been carefully vetted for best-in-class security and data privacy practices. For more information,please see ourlist of subprocessors.
Data governance relates to the policies and procedures that dictate how data is procured and used throughout its life cycle. From creation and collection to processing, distribution, storage and deletion.
Notion’s commitment to data governance is key to keeping our users data secure, private, accurate, and accessible.
----
At Notion, we believe in privacy by design, which means that privacy considerations are built into every aspect of our products and services from the outset. This includes the development of new products, features, and the selection of vendors.
Notion conducts regular training with our personnel to reinforce the concept that Notion needs to think of user privacy at all stages of the development lifecycle.
Companies generally have a duty to back up their information in multiple places. To help with this Notion offers the option to save any Notion page, database, and non-database page to your computer in various formats. This way our customers can further protect themselves by backing up their information at any time.
----
Notion’s data import function lets you upload information from external sources and combine it with the data already held in your workspace.
Like most people, you probably have data, documents, and notes scattered across many files and apps. You can centralize your information in one place by moving it all into Notion.

Your workspace must be on an Enterprise plan
Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 protocol
----
Only a Workspace Owner can configure SCIM for a Notion workspace
If you want to use SCIM to modify a user's name or email address, you must have verified ownership over their email domain.Learn more about domain verification →
Enterprise Plan Workspace owners can generate and view SCIM API tokens by going toSettings & members→Security & identity→SCIM configuration.
To generate a new token, click on the+ New Tokenbutton in the right corner.
A unique token is generated for each Workspace owner that only they can view.
----
When a Workspace owner leaves the workspace or their role is changed, their token will be revoked. When this happens, an automated message will be sent to the remaining Workspace owners to notify them to replace the revoked token.
In addition, active tokens can be revoked by any of the Workspace owners in the workspace. To revoke a token, click the🗑alongside the respective token.
If a token is revoked, you will need to replace it in any existing integrations.
Any SCIM integration and user provisioning relying on the revoked token will be disabled until it is replaced by an active token.
Note:To avoid breaking existing integrations, make sure to replace any tokens associated with an admin before de-provisioning them.
----
To control whether users will receive invitations to workspaces and groups via email when provisioned by SCIM, enterprise plan workspaces owners can go toSettings & members→Identity & provisioning→SCIM provisioning→Suppress invite emails from SCIM provisioning. Toggle this setting on if you don’t want to send emails to users.

Q&A
Note:Q&A is in beta, which means it’s still a work in progress and may not be available to you yet.Learn more about Q&A beta below →
Whenever someone uses Q&A,Q&A only looks at the pages that they have access to in their workspaceto answer their question. Q&A will never use information from pages that someone doesn’t have access to.
Q&A will only reference pages that you have created or been invited to, or pages whose privacy settings are set toEveryone at {your workspace}.
----
Q&A’s responses to your questions depend on the content in your workspace. The more content there is, the better — we recommend having at least 100 pages in your workspace to make the most of this feature. If you don’t have enough content, we might ask you toimport contentinto your workspace before you use Q&A.
It can take around an hour before new content you’ve created is referenced by Q&A.
If Q&A can’t answer a question based on the information in your workspace, it will let you know instead of giving you an inaccurate answer. This can also help you identify and close gaps in your documentation, and make Q&A work even better for your team.
Perform quick skills, like creating a new page or adding a diagram to a page.
----
Search across thousands of pages in your workspace to find the answer to your question, in just a few seconds.
Answer questions about specific pages, people, and databases. You can use @-mentions when you ask Q&A a question.
Synthesize information from databases and database properties.
Know what page you’re on.
Answer questions using GPT-4’s general knowledge of the world.
Cite specific blocks in Notion pages when it answers a question.
Answer questions using content that’s in an embed, like a video or a PDF.
Edit existing content in a page.
Filter or perform aggregations on databases, such as counting the number of rows in a view.
Here are some examples ofgood questions to askQ&A:
----
What are the key themes from last week’s marketing team standup meeting?
What’s the process for onboarding a new contractor?
What has my team been working on this week?
Can you create an itinerary for a trip to Tokyo?
Here are some examples ofquestions that Q&A might have trouble answering:
Can you add a simple table to this page with 3 columns and 5 rows?
Can you file a task in this database?

Relations & rollups
Let's say you have two databases for your theoretical business 😉
One that tracks customers
One that tracks items purchased
You want to know both which customers bought which items, as well as which items were purchased by which customers. This is a job for relations!
In the two tables above, the columns labeled↗ Items Purchasedand↗ Customersare relation properties, which can be added like any other database property.
Here, when you add an item bought into theCustomersdatabase, the customers who bought them automatically appear in the↗ Customerscolumn in theItemsdatabase.
Connect yourdatabase of restaurantswith yourdatabase of neighborhoodsso you can see which restaurants are in which neighborhoods at a glance.
----
Connect yourdatabase of meeting noteswith yourdatabase of clientsto provide quick access to the notes relevant to each client.
Connect yourdatabase of taskswith yourdatabase of bigger projectsto understand how projects are broken down into tasks, and how tasks contribute to projects.
Connect yourdatabase of candidateswith yourdatabase of interviewersto keep track of who interviewed whom.
To relate two databases, you need two databases. So let's assume you've made theCustomersandItemsdatabases above for the purpose of this walkthrough.
Add a new column/property to yourCustomersdatabase and give it a name, likeItems Purchased.
Search forRelation.
Then, search for the database you want to create the relation with.
----
You'll see a preview of the relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database.
Click the blueAdd relationbutton to finalize the creation of the new relation property.
Now when you click in a cell in this relation column, you'll bring up a menu where you can search for and choose items from the other database to add.
For example, this is how you can add which clothes each customer bought.
To add an item, click the name in the list. To delete an item, hover over and then click the–button on the right.
Tip:To change the database you're connecting to, re-selectRelationas the property type for that particularly property. You'll be prompted to choose a new database.
----
Relations are created as one-way by default. But you can easily toggle on a corresponding relation in the destination database.
With two-way relations, the edits work both ways! So if you add a customer to theItemsdatabase in the relation column, the change pops up in yourCustomersdatabase.
Follow the above instructions to create a new relation property.
Click the toggle that saysShow on [name of related database]. In our example, this saysShow on Items DB.
Give this corresponding relation a name.
Below, you'll see a preview of the two-way relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database,anda relation from the Items database to the Customer database.
----
Click the blueAdd relationbutton to finalize the creation of these two new relation properties.
When you create a relation, you're essentially adding Notion pages stored in one database into the property field of another.
These pages can be opened and edited like any other! Click on the page in the relation column. Then click on it again in the window that pops up.
You can also remove any related page by hovering over and clicking the–at the right.
You can choose to limit the number of pages that can be included in your relations property – with the option to select1 pageor to haveNo limit.

If you select the option to limit it to1 page, people using your database will only be able to select 1 page in the relation. This is especially useful for situations where only one page should be related to one another, for example - if only one order number should be associated with each purchase.
Relations can be displayed on pages in three different ways.
To change the display:
While on a database page, click on the relation.
ClickShow asand select one of the following:
As property: The relation will be displayed at the top of the page, alongside all the page properties.
As page section: The relation will be displayed right above the page body, as its own section. Best option if you want the relation to standout.
----
Minimal: The relation will be display right above the page body, but with the content hidden.
Note:If you want to change a relation fromMinimalto another display, click•••->Customize page.
When you set up a relation in your database, you can also choose to display certain properties of linked pages. For example, let’s say you have a database of frequently asked questions at your company. Each FAQ has a relation to a page that further explains the answer to the question. You might want people to also be able to see the owner of each page, so they know who to reach out to with more questions. You can set your FAQ database up so that the owner is visible along with the relevant page!
To do this:
----
Open a page in a database that has a relation property.
Click the field next to that property to link a page → click•••.
In the menu that appears, drag the properties of the related database into or out ofShown in relationorHidden in relation.
Once you’re done, you’ll see your desired properties appear in the relation field. This will apply to all of the pages in your current database.
Let's say you want items in the same database to have relationships with each other. For example, you have a tasks database and you want each task to relate to other tasks.
Start off by creating a new relation.
Then search for and choose the database you're currently working in.
You'll now see that the database is related toThis database.
----
Just as with relations between two databases, you can choose to make this a one-way relation or two-way relation.
To make it a two-way relation, toggle onSeparate properties. You'll see a second property show up.
Rollups help you aggregate data in your databases based on relations. Going back to our customers and items example above, let's say you wanted to know how much each customer spent based on what they bought.
First, create the relation so you know who bought what.
Add a new column/property and chooseRollupfrom theProperty typemenu. Give it a descriptive name.
Clicking on any cell in the rollup column will bring up a new menu asking you for:
The relation property you want to roll up.
----
The property of those related pages you want to roll up.
The calculation you want to apply to them.
So, for our example, you'd choose to roll up the relation propertyItems Purchasedand thePriceproperty within those pages. Then you'd chooseSumas the calculation.
Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column.
There are different calculations you can apply as a rollup. Here are all of them:
Show original: This just shows all related pages in the same cell. It's the same as the relation property itself.
Show unique values: This shows each unique value in the selected property for all related pages.
----
Count all: Counts the total number of values in the selected property for all related pages.
Count values: Counts the number of non-empty values in the selected property for all related pages.
Count unique values: Counts the number of unique values in the selected property for all related pages.
Count empty: Counts the number of related pages with an empty value for the property selected. So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1.
Count not empty: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.
Percent empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.
----
Percent not empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.
These rollup calculations are only available forNumberproperties:
Sum: Computes the sum of the numeric properties for related pages (like above).
Average: Computes the average of the numeric properties for related pages.
Median: Finds the median of the numeric properties for related pages.
Min: Finds the lowest number in the numeric property for related pages.
Max: Finds the highest number in the numeric property for related pages.
Range: Computes the range between the highest and lowest numbers in the numeric property for related pages (Max-Min).
These rollup calculations are only available forDateproperties:
----
Earliest date: Finds the earliest date/time in the date property for all related pages.
Latest date: Finds the latest date/time in the date property for all related pages.
Date range: Computes the span of time between the latest and earliest dates in the date property for related pages.
In both tables and boards, you can apply calculations to your rollup column to get a sense of sums, ranges, averages, etc. for your entire database.
Let's say you want to find the total money spent by all customers in our example.
At the bottom of your Customers table, under your rollup column, clickCalculate.
ChooseSumto add all the values in that column together and get a grand total.
Can I export or import relations?
----
When you export a relational database as a CSV file, the relation properties will export as plain text URLs. For now, you can't re-import that CSV back into Notion to re-establish the relations with other databases.
Can I duplicate a database with a relation?
Yes, but the following will happen which can be kind of confusing:
If you create a copy of the Customers database in the example above, you'll see a new relation property automatically appear in the Items database.
This happens because relations sync two ways in Notion. When a database is duplicated, you also duplicate its relationships with other databases. You'll get the hang of it! 💪
Can I rollup a rollup?
----
Unfortunately not, as this could create unintended loops. We recommend sticking to rolling up other properties 😊
Tailor your database to your needs with lots of customization options to choose from ✨

SAML SSO
Notion’s single sign-on (SSO) services are built upon the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard that permits identity managers to safely pass authorization credentials to service providers like Notion and connect your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience.
SSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.
----
Note:SAML SSO is available for workspaces on Notion'sBusiness or Enterprise Plans.Contact sales to learn more →
Streamlines user management across systems for workspace owners.
Removes the need for end-users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies end-users experience by allowing them to sign in at one single access point and enjoy a seamless experience across multiple applications.
Note:Only members can access a workspace via SSO. Guests are not supported.
Learn more about members and guests in a Notion workspace →
Your workspace must be on a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan.
Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.
Only a workspace owner can configure SAML SSO for a Notion workspace.
----
At least one domain has been verified by a Workspace owner.
Go toSettings & members, then select theSettingstab.
In theAllow email domainssection, remove all email domains.
Then select theIdentity & provisioningtab.
Verify one or more domains.See instructions for domain verification here →
Toggle onEnable SAML SSOand the SAML SSO Configuration modal will automatically appear and prompt you to complete the set-up.
The SAML SSO Configuration modal is divided into two parts:
TheAssertion Consumer Service (ACS) URLis to be entered in your Identity Provider (IdP) portal
TheIdentity Provider Detailsis a field in which either an IdP URL or IdP metadata XML must be provided to Notion.
----
For more information on where to enter and obtain this information, please refer to our IdP-specific guides below.
Note:Guests are not supported with SAML SSO on Notion.
From the workspace where you have verified your domain and enabled SAML SSO, there is aLinked workspacessection listing all of the workspaces associated with your SAML SSO configuration.
Users with a verified email address who have access to the primary workspace or one of the linked workspaces will be able to log in via SAML SSO.Sales-assisted Enterprise customers can add Enterprise workspaces to their SAML SSO configuration or remove them by reaching out to team@makenotion.com.
----
Once you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for a single workspace, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other log-in methods such as username/password and Google Authentication.
To ensure users can only log in using SAML SSO and no other method, update theLogin methodtoOnly SAML SSO. Once this happens, workspace users will be logged out and required to log back in using SAML SSO.
SAML SSO will only be enforced for users who use your verified domain and have access to the primary workspace or a linked workspace.
Guests invited to pages in a Notion workspace can’t use SAML SSO to login. Instead, they’ll always use their e-mail and password or log in with Google or Apple.
----
Workspace owners will always have the option to bypass SAML SSO by using their email and password credentials. This is to allow them to access Notion in the event of IdP/SAML failure. They will be able to log in and disable or update their configuration.
Notion supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the workspace automatically as a member.
To enable Just-in-Time provisioning:
InSettings & members→Identity & provisioning, make sure thatAutomatic account creationis enabled.
----
Note:We don’t recommend enabling Just-in Time provisioning if you are using SCIM. Having an “allowed email domain” in place allows users on that domain to join the workspace so there could be a mismatch between membership in their Identity Providers and Notion.
These are instructions for setting up Notion SAML SSO with Entra ID (formerly Azure), Google, Okta, and OneLogin. If you use a different Identity Provider and need assistance with configuration, pleasecontact our support team.
For additional documentation, you can also reference steps on Entra ID's website here:

For detailed documentation, you can reference Rippling's websitehere→
If you don't use one of Notion’s supported SAML providers, you can also configure your IdP to use SAML with Notion.
Step 1: Set up yourIdP
Your IdP must support the SAML 2.0 spec to be used with Notion.
Configure the ACS URL to the value Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL from Notion. You can find this inSettings→Identity & Provisioning→Edit SAML SSO Configuration.
ConfigureNameIDtourn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress.
----
Similarly, configureusernametourn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress.
ConfigureEntityIDtohttps://notion.so/sso/saml. You can find this inSettings→ the bottom ofIdentity & Provisioning.
Configure the following attributes:
emailAddress: This is a user's email address. Most IdPs set this by default.
(Optional)firstName
(Optional)lastName
(Optional)profilePicture
Copy the IdP metadata URL or IdP metadata XML for next steps.
Step 2: Set up SAML in Notion
In Notion, clickSettings & members→Settings→Identity & provisioning.
Add new email domains and follow the prompts to verify them. These must be email domains of your users logging into Notion.
----
InSAML Single sign-on (SSO)settings, toggleEnable SAML SSOon. This will open the SAML SSO Configurationdialog.
UnderIdentity Provider Details, input the IdP metadata URL or IdP metadata XML from your IdP.
Make sure you provide your desired inputs forLogin method,Automatic account creation, andLinked workspaces.
To switch identity providers, go toSettings & membersin your left sidebar →Identity & provisioning→Edit SAML SSO configuration. Enter your new information, then selectSave changes.
When switching to a new IdP, we recommend that:
SSO not be enforced during the transition, so you can minimize the risk of locking users out.
Email addresses for the users under your new IdP match the user’s email in Notion.
----
Note: Changing identity providers does not end user sessions or deactivate users.
If you encounter errors when setting up SAML SSO, check to make sure your IdP's metadata, SAML requests and responses are valid XML against the SAML XSD schemas. You can do so using this online tool:https://www.samltool.com/validate_xml.php
Note that we do not support theEntitiesDescriptorelement. If your IdP's metadata contains this element, extract the containedEntityDescriptorelement and try again.
Why is the current Enable SAML SSO greyed out?
----
The most common reason is that you have not yet verified ownership of a domain. If this is the case, you will notice that you either don’t have any domains listed in the verify email domain section or the domain is pending verification.
For next steps,refer to our instructions on how to complete domain verification here →
Why can’t I edit the SAML SSO settings?
----
The most common reason is that you are trying to modify the verified domains or SSO configuration from a linked workspace which is a workspace that is already associated with another SSO configuration.In linked workspaces, all domain management and SSO configuration settings are read-only. To modify the SSO configuration or remove this workspace from the SSO configuration, you must have access to the primary workspace. The name of the primary workspace can be found at the top of theIdentity & Provisioningsettings tab.
Why do I need to verify a domain to enable SSO?
We ask that the email domain ownership is validated to ensure that only the owner of the domain can customize how their users log into Notion.
----
Having trouble setting up SSO? Here are some common issues:
Try using a URL instead of an XML.
We recommend testing the setup process with a test account before enforcing it for users.
If neither of these options help, reach out to support at
team@makenotion.com.
Why should I remove email domains from the “Allowed Email Domains” setting before configuring SAML SSO for my workspace?
The “Allowed Email Domain” setting allows users with the selected domains to access your workspace without being provisioned via your IdP. To ensure that only users provisioned via your IdP can access your SAML-enabled workspace, disable this feature by removing all email addresses from the “Allowed Email Domain” list.
----
Can I still log in to Notion if my identity provider is out of service?
Yes, even with SAML enforced, Workspace owners have the option to log in with email. Thereafter, a Workspace owner can change the SAML configuration to disableEnforce SAMLso users may log in with email again.
Are profile photos transmitted to Notion from the IdP?
Yes, profilePhoto is an optional custom attribute. You may assign this attribute to a corresponding attribute in your IdP, provided the attribute contains the URL to an image. If the profilePhoto field is set, this image will replace the avatar in Notion when the user signs in using SAML SSO.
How do I allow admins of other workspaces in my SAML configuration create new workspaces?
----
Only the admins of your primary workspace will be able to create new workspaces using your verified domain(s). Please reach out to our support team (team@makenotion.com) to switch your primary SAML workspace to another linked workspace in your SAML configuration.

----
For example, if you search for "Urgent," your database will quickly filter to only display entries that contain "Urgent" in the title or property values:
Database search searches property values such asStatus=In Progressor the names of database entries.
Workspace search searches content inside database pages.
Are there any limitations to the type of content that search looks at?
There's a few content types that search won't surface, unfortunately. We're always working on improvements, but here's a current list of limitations:
Date mentions such as@Todayor@last Tuesdaywill be included in search results, but other @mentions of pages and people such as@Dougor@Roadmapwon't be included in search results.
----
Comments and discussions are not included in search results.
Property values such as select and multi-select tags are not included in search results. You can use database search for this though!
What about Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters?
You can use queries with CJK characters in search! This is an experience we are continuing to improve💪 Please feel free to share any search feedback with team@makenotion.com, or click?at the bottom right of Notion to send us a message.
Is there a way to customize the preset filters, recent pages, or recent searches?

There are also different actions that people can take in a workspace depending on their role in the workspace. To learn more, readthis article →
Note:If someone has requested a change in their permissions on a page you own, you’ll be able to see, approve, and reject those requests from yourInbox.
To change someone’s permission level for a specific page:
SelectShareat the top of the page.
----
Open the dropdown next to the name of a person, group, or teamspace with whom the page has been shared.
Select a permission level.
When you create a subpage inside of a page, that subpage will take on the permissions of its parent page. To change this, go into a subpage and update the permissions there.
Teamspace owners can set default permissions for content in their teamspace. This will apply to every new page created in the teamspace, and if you want to change them, you’ll have to make changes at the page level.
----
Notion respects thebroadest level of accessgiven to a user. For example, let's say you give Member ACan viewpermissions to a page. Then you give everyone in your workspaceFull access, Member A will also get full access because they are member in your workspace.
Additionally, moving a shared page to thePrivatesection of your sidebar will remove everyone else's access on that page.Note:This override will only apply to the parent page — the permissions granted for any subpages will remain the same.
If a page is set to be accessible toAnyone with link, note that even those that don’t have the direct link may be able to access in certain cases including the following:
The page is mentioned in or linked from another page shared more broadly.
----
The page uses atwo-way relationthat links to another page shared more broadly.
The page is nested inside another page that has been shared more broadly.
You can tell who else has access to a page because their profile photos can be seen in the bar at the very top of the page.
An avatar appears faded out if that person is not currently looking at the page.
An avatar appears unfaded if the person is currently on the page.
Hovering over an avatar will show you the person's name, email, and when they were last on the page.
Clicking on an active avatar will jump you to the part of the page where they're reading or typing.
----
When people are collaborating on the same page at the same time, you'll see their avatars move next to the blocks they are looking at or editing.
Click•••at the top right of any page and look at the bottom of the menu that pops up. You'll see who last edited the page and when.
If you open a page that you don’t have access to, you can selectNo accesson the page to send a request. This will notify the page’s creators or editors, who can choose to accept or deny your access request.
If you have view or comment access to a page and want edit access:
Open the page and selectShare.
In theSharetab, you’ll see what level of permissions you currently have. Open the dropdown next to this information.
SelectRequest edit access.
----
This request will go to the page creator, who can accept or ignore it. You’ll be notified once your request has been accepted — try refreshing the page if you’re not able to edit it.
If you’re a workspace owner on an Enterprise plan, you can control content sharing with additional security settings. Learn more about these featureshere →
To see these settings, go toSettings & membersin your sidebar, then selectSecurity & data.
I tried adding a guest to my workspace but they were turned into a member automatically. How can I prevent that?
----
If your workspace is above the guest limit for yourplan, new users that you share content with will be automatically added as a member (instead of as a guest) if they have the same organization email domain.
To allow for a new user with the same organization email domain to be added as a guest, you will need to remove existing guests to fall below your plan limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers).
----
If your workspace is above the guest limit for yourplan, you may have the Allowed Email Domains setting turned on. When enabled, this feature allows people with that email domain to join your workspace as a member automatically. You can disable this setting in the Settings tab of Settings & Members in the left sidebar.
I want to share a page with a client, but they don't use Notion.
----
You can enable Share to the web in the Share menu, and share the URL with them. As long as you keep the Search engine indexing setting disabled (always disabled by default), only people with that exact URL will be able to access the page. They'll be able to view the page, even if they don't have a Notion account. However, they won't be able to make any edits, leave comments, or sort/filter a database.
My Export button is missing, it doesn't appear in any menus.
You may have theDisable Exportsetting enabled in theSettingstab ofSettings & Membersin your left sidebar. You'll need to be an admin in your workspace, and on desktop to change this.
----
Can I limit access to different parts of a database? Can you make it so that some people can see certain database views or properties, but not others?
Unfortunately, database permissions don't get quite that granular yet 😓 It’s a legit use case though, and definitely something we want to support in the future. Stay tuned!
It's easy to work with others in Notion. Add members to collaborate together within a workspace. Want to work with people outside your team? Invite them as guests to view, comment on, or edit specific pages within the workspace 💌

Get Slack notifications when certain things happen in Notion. There are two ways you can set up these notifications:
You can choose to only be notified when you’re mentioned in a page, a comment, or a person property in a database.
You can choose to be notified when all of the above happens, as well as when:
----
You get a comment on a page you own, or a comment is added to a comment thread you’re already a part of.
A property is changed in a database that you’veset up notificationsfor.
You’re invited to a page.
Someone has requested access to a page that you own.

When you paste a Notion link in Slack, it’ll unfurl to provide useful information about your page. For database pages with theAI summary property, Slack will automatically unfurl the AI summary.
You can also grant access permissions to the unfurled Notion page directly from inside Slack.
On a Notion page, clickShare.
Click into the search bar.
SelectAdd contacts from Slack.
Search for the person you want to invite, then selectInvite.
Can I choose to use just one part of the integration?
----
Unfortunately, this is not possible today. When you install Notion’s Slack integration you’ll have the full functionality/all features of the Slack integration.
However, since only users with edit access to a page can set up Notion notifications to Slack, you can control parts of the integration by restricting permissions.
What permission level is required to create a database notification?
A user needsFull Accessto a Notion database to be able to set up database notifications.
Anyone with at leastViewaccess to a database can see all the existing Slack notifications that have been set up. However, they can’t edit or create any themselves.
How do permissions work when I share a Notion page in a Slack channel?
----
The user that shares the pagewill get a prompt informing them some people in the channeldon't have access to the doc. The user is then able to decide if they want to share the page with the people that don't have access. They also have the option to delete the page preview in Slack.
Can admins control who can connect Slack to a Notion workspace?
As an admin in Slack you can manage settings that give you approval rights for any Slack integration. The same settings will apply to Notion if you choose to turn them on.
On Enterprise plans, Notion admins can also restrict members from installing the Slack integration using their admin permissions to manage connections.
----
Where can you view and manage the Slack notifications you've set up in your Notion workspace?
Database notifications can be managed and edited in the the individual database they’ve been created in. There is currently no way to see all database notification workflows in your workspace from one central place.
Personal @-mention notifications can be managed fromSettings and members→My notifications & settings
When one person connects Notion to Slack, does that turn it on for everyone?
No, when one user sets up the integration all Slack users will be able to see an unfurled Notion page link or a Slack link preview in Notion.
But to use the functionality themselves, other users have to connect Slack individually.
----
How do I send Slack messages to a specific database view?
The easiest way to send a Slack message to a specific database view (e.g. you might have a view for only your team’s tasks), is to copy the link to the database view and paste that link into the send to Notion prompt in Slack.
When you send a Slack message to a specific database view, the properties are auto-filled for you. No need to update them yourself manually!
Does the @-mentioned notification in Slack work when a user is mentioned as part of a group @-mention in Notion?
Yes. A group mention in Notion will trigger the @mention notification in Slack to all members of the Notion group that have the Slack @mention turned on.
----
Are there other 3rd party integrations providers and can I continue to use them (e.g. Zapier)?
Yes those integrations will continue to work as before
Will this new integration impact how I currently use Slack link previews?
Slack link previews will continue to exist and work normally.
If you'd like to use the new features (send messages to Notion, notifications in Slack, and expandable links) you'll need to re-install the Slack integrationhere

Task databases & sprints
Task databases and sprints help your team easily manage time-boxed work and stick to a schedule.
A task database in Notion is a type of database that requires a status, assignee, and due date property to help you track the work that you need to get done.
To create a task database or turn an existing database into a task database:
Open your database and select•••at the top.
SelectCustomize {your database's name}.
Search forTasks.
SelectAddnext toTasks.
Pick which properties in your database will correspond with the task status, assignee, and due date. If your database doesn’t already have these properties, you can create them by selectingCreate new.
SelectTurn into task database.
----
Any tasks assigned to you from that database will appear in My tasks. My tasks is a widget inside Home that helps you track your tasks across all task databases in your workspace in one place. Learn morehere →
If you no longer want a database to be a task database:
Open your database and select•••at the top.
SelectCustomize {your database's name}.
Search for and selectTasks.
SelectRemove.
To use Sprints, you must have a Task database in Notion. You can turn any database in Notion into a Task database followingthese instructions.
Once you have a Task database, you can add Sprints to your set-up. To do this:
Open your database and select•••at the top.
SelectCustomize {your database's name}.
Search forSprints.
SelectAddnext toSprints.
----
SelectTurn on sprints.
Once you turn on sprints for your database, a few items will be created to help you track them.These will be accessible in your Notion sidebar, alongside the original database you used to set up sprints.
TheSprint boardis where you can track all of the tasks belonging to your current and future sprints, using a few different views:
Current Sprint: Shows tasks in the current sprint.
Sprint planning: Shows tasks in the current, next, and last sprint, as well as any tasks not yet assigned to a sprint.
Backlog: Shows tasks not assigned to a sprint.
----
TheSprintsdatabase will give you a general view of your current and future sprints. You can open any sprint's page to view the tasks within. You'll also notice aTimelineview, which gives you a more linear look at your sprints.
If you’ve accidentally deleted theCurrent Sprintview and want to recreate it:
Set up a view in the original task database that you’d like to use as yourCurrent Sprintview.
Select•••at the top right →Customize {your database's name}→Sprints→Manage sprint from this view.
In theSprint board, go to theSprint planningview.
Move any unfinished tasks from your current sprint or from the backlog into the next sprint.
To mark a sprint as complete:
In theSprint board, go to yourCurrentsprint.
SelectComplete sprint.
----
You'll be asked to confirm the dates of your next sprint and what you'd like to do with the incomplete tasks from your current sprint. You can move them to the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in the current sprint.
SelectComplete Sprint.
Alternatively, you can seamlessly transition from one sprint to the next by setting sprints to automatically complete.Learn about how to set your sprints to automatically complete and begin below →
When you complete a sprint:
The status of yourCurrentsprint will be changed toLast. Whichever sprint was currently assigned toLast, if there is one, will now be set toPast.
The status of theNextsprint will be changed toCurrent.
The tasks on the board will reflect the newCurrentsprint.
----
TheNextsprint will be created if none exists.
Customize your sprints to fit your needs. To do this, go to your sprint board and select•••→Customize {your database's name}→Sprints. From here, you can adjust the following:
Duration: Choose how many weeks (from one to eight) you want each sprint to run for.
----
Start on: Choose which day of the week you want your sprints to begin on. If you change this in the middle of an active sprint, the current sprint’s dates will change. For example, if your sprints used to run for two weeks starting on Mondays, but you want your sprints to run for two weeks starting on Thursdays, your current sprint will run until two weeks after the upcoming Thursday, so that your next sprint can begin on Thursday as you indicated.
Incomplete tasks: Choose what will happen to any incomplete tasks from your sprints. You can put them in the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in their original sprint.
----
Automated sprints: Turn this on if you want sprints to complete automatically before the next one is automatically created and started.
Turn off sprints: Choose this to turn off a sprint. Once you turn sprints off, your sprints database, sprint board, and relations between tasks and sprints will be permanently deleted. If you choose to turn sprints on again, you’ll start with a brand new database, board, and relations.
Note:
You can’t adjust the dates in your sprints database because these dates are either populated based on the settings above, or set when you manually complete a sprint.
----
If you need to break your sprint cadence temporarily, like for the holidays, we suggest turning off automatic sprints and waiting until you’re ready to resume your normal sprint cadence before starting your next sprint.

SelectBoardfrom the dropdown menu.
Note:Timelines only work if you have at least one date property in your database containing a range of dates. Otherwise nothing will be plotted.
Edit your timeline so it does the job you need it to do. There are several ways to change the appearance of your timeline and the projects you plot on it however is most helpful to you.
You can view your projects on any time scale, from hours all the way up to years.
On the right side of your timeline, to the left of< Today >, you'll see a dropdown menu with a unit of time.
----
Your timeline will automatically adjust to show your current projects rendered on the new time scale.
Hover over the left or right edge of any project. Your cursor will indicate that you can drag and drop each edge to make it as long or short as you want it to be.
You'll see date indicators appear to guide you.
Note:You'll see small arrows appear on each row of your timeline to indicate that a project has occurred before or after your current view, or included scope before or after. You can click on these arrows to jump right to the project.
At any time, you can jump to the current day on your timeline. Just click< Today >on the right side underneath the top level menu.

In Notion, you can show a table to the left of your timeline so you can always see a full list of your projects no matter when they are scheduled.
To show or hide table in any timeline, click the>>or<<on the left.
Depending on how many projects you have in a timeline, and what you're using the timeline for, you may want to only see 10 project pages at a time, or many more. To set your preference:

SelectLoad limitand select a number of pages.
Timelines give you a few ways to display properties at a glance so you can see information about your projects right away.
Click•••at the top right of your timeline and thenProperties.

You will see all your properties in this menu displayed next to a toggle. To show properties directly on your project cards in your timeline, toggle them on. To hide them, toggle them off.
When showing a table in your timeline, you'll also have the option to display properties as frozen columns to the left. You can toggle these on and off in thePropertiesmenu, too, but only if you haveShow tableswitched on.
You can also hide properties displayed in this table portion of your timeline by clicking on your column headers and choosingHidefrom the menu.

Is there a way to add conditional formatting? Like change the color of projects plotted on my timeline or background color of cells in the table?
Not yet, unfortunately. It's a popular feature request though, so definitely on our radar! For the time being, you can useSelectandMulti-selectproperties to add a pop of color to your timeline 🎨
Why can't I delete the Name property when showing table in my timeline?
----
Timelines are essentially databases, and databases are essentially lists of items. That's what goes in theNameproperty. All the other data points contained are attributes of these items, like due dates, owners, tags and more. You can't remove theNameproperty because that's the core information contained. You can, however, rename that property to align with whatever you are working on.
Is there a way to skip the modal view, and always Open as Page by default?
Yes!
Clickthe•••at the top right of your database.
UnderLayout, clickOpen pages inand selectFull page.
Does Notion have simple (non-database) tables?
Yes!Learn more about simple tables here →
How can I turn a full page database into an inline database?
----
If it's not already, drag the database from your sidebar into another page. It will become sub-page
Go to that page, click the⋮⋮button next to the database sub-page and selectTurn into inline.
Click the⋮⋮button and selectTurn into pageto change it back.
Calendars let you visualize how database items connect to certain dates. Use one when you want a bird's-eye view for important launch dates, multi-day events, or even projects spanning multiple months 🗓️

Transfer content from a deprovisioned user
When a user is deleted, deprovisioned, or leaves a workspace, they may leave behind private page content. This feature allows a Workspace owner of an Enterprise Plan workspace to transfer this content to another, current user so it is easily recovered.
Note:This process applies on a user’sprivate contentafter they have left a workspace. Content shared with a current workspace member willnotbe transferrable.
A Workspace owner is able to reassign the private content of a user who has recently left the workspace if:
The user is not currently part of the workspace (they have been deprovisioned)
The user had private pages
The user’s private pages were not already reassigned to another user
----
The user was part of the workspace fewer than 30 days ago
The workspace is on an Enterprise Plan subscription
Visit yourSettings & membersand click theMemberssection.
Navigate to theRecently leftusers tab.
For the user who has been deprovisioned (the “recently left user”), select the destination where you would like to send the deprovisioned user’s private pages.
You will see a confirmation modal; selectTransfer private pagesto continue the private page transfer process.
All of the deprovisioned user's private pages will appear in the destination user’s sidebar, nested under a new top-level private page.
Note:A user who has had all their private pages reassigned will no longer be visible in theRecently leftlist.
----
If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, workspace owners will be able to restore their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership. To do this, simply add a member back to your workspace and their content and access will be automatically restored once they rejoin.
Audit logs give workspace owners access to detailed information about security and safety-related activity. This can help identify potential security issues, investigate suspicious behavior, and troubleshoot access 🔦

Move & duplicate content
Note:
When you move content from one place to another, your content will be duplicated into the destination workspace or account, and the original content will continue to live where it used to.
In the process of duplicating pages from one place to another, some content or settings in the duplicated page may be broken. This could include links, relations, permissions, page history, and more. We recommend keeping your original content until you're absolutely sure the duplicated content is set up correctly.
If you have multiple workspaces associated with your Notion account and you want to duplicate content from one workspace to another:
----
Select+ New pagein the sidebar of the workspace associated with the content you want to duplicate — this page will contain all of the content you want to duplicate to make it easier for you to do so in bulk.
From your sidebar, drag all the pages you want to duplicate into that new page.
Open the new page, then select•••→Move to.
Open the dropdown next to your current workspace’s name, then select the destination workspace.
Find a place in your destination workspace for your duplicated pages to live.
SelectI understand, duplicate.

How is the Free Plan different from the Plus Plan?
----
The Plus Plan supports additional members, so multiple people can share a collaborative workspace together. It also includes some extra features like more version history, larger file uploads and more guests.
What is a block?
A block is any single piece of content you add to your page, like a paragraph of text, a to-do item, an image, a code block, an embedded file, etc. Think of your page as being made up of these building blocks.
Can I use Notion for free?
Absolutely! The Free Plan is completely free for individual use.
If you add additional members to the Free Plan, you can collaborate with with a limit block trial, which provides more than enough to try out Notion with your team before upgrading to the Plus Plan.
----
Do you offer student discounts?
The Plus Plan (with a 1-member limit) is free for students and educators. Compared to the Free Plan, you’ll be able to add more guests, have access to more version history, and upload larger files.
Just sign up with your school email address and you’ll immediately gain access to these features. Thousands of school email domains are eligible, not just .edu!
For more info & FAQs,visit the Notion for Education page.
What are the admin tools in the Plus Plan and Enterprise Plan?
On the Plus Plan and Enterprise Plan, the admin tools let you limit Workspace owner rights to specific people only, so that only Workspace owners can change billing information, add more teammates, or change important workspace settings.
----
Admin tools are not available on the Free Plan, where every member is an admin by default.
How is pricing calculated for the paid plans?
If you upgrade your workspace to one of the paid plans, you will be charged a fee per member.
Guests are free of charge – but they can only access individual pages they are invited to. In other words, guests won’t be able to see all the team pages under theTeamspacessection in the left sidebar.
Do you have monthly and yearly billing options?
Yes! We offer both monthly and yearly billing options, but you save more with yearly billing.Find more information on monthly and yearly pricing for our plans here →
How does adding and removing members work?
----
Whether you're on a monthly or yearly billing schedule, your account may be charged on a monthly basis if you make these types of changes. If you added members, your account will be charged a prorated amount based on the percentage of the billing cycle left at the time each member was added. If you removed members, your account will be credited in the same way.
What happens when I change plans?
Upgrading your plan:Your account will be upgraded and charged immediately. The amount due will be reduced based on the percentage of the billing cycle left at the time the plan was changed.
Downgrading your plan:Your account will be downgraded at the end of your billing cycle.
How do I cancel my paid plan?
----
Your Notion subscription, annual or monthly, will automatically renew until you cancel it. You can cancel your subscription by going to "Settings & members" in the left-hand sidebar on a desktop computer, then selecting "Billing," then "Change plan." After you cancel, you’ll still have access to all the paid features until the end of your billing cycle.
More on billing & payment here
What happens if my payment fails? Like if my credit card expires?
Your account email will be notified after each failed payment. Payments may be retried up to 8 times within the next month.
After this, if the payment did not succeed, your workspace will get restricted to view-only for a period of time before being downgraded to the Free plan.
----
Can I change my payment method?
You can change your payment method at any time in your billing settings.
How do refunds work?
Our refund policy is simple. If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Notion subscription online or in-app, please contact us inside the app or emailteam@makenotion.com. We'll be happy to refund you the full amount (not pro-rated) if you downgrade your subscription within 72 hours of signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of signing up for annual billing.
----
If you were invoiced for members accidentally added to your workspace, we're happy to provide a refund of the prorated charges if you reach out within 72 hours of the invoice date (please make sure the additional members have been removed from your workspace when writing in).
And if for any reason you're unhappy with Notion, please let us know at team@makenotion.com — we'd love to hear your feedback, and will be happy to work with you to create the best experience possible.
Do you have a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)?
We do not offer a standard SLA. For teams with greater than 100 members, we can offer a custom SLA.
Contact salesto learn more
How is my payment being processed?
----
We use Stripe to process your payment. It’s the same payment provider used by products such as Twitter, Pinterest, and Lyft. We do not handle your credit card information directly.
Can I belong to multiple teams on Notion?
Yes! You can use the same email address to create and join multiple teams. However, each one of these workspaces is on its own plan and needs to be upgraded individually.
Can I change my plan settings on mobile?
No, you can only make modifications to your Notion plan on desktop or web.

Use Notion Calendar with Notion
To connect Notion Calendar to Notion:
Open Notion Calendar on desktop or web.
Go toSettings→Notion.
Next toAdd Notion workspace, selectConnect.
Give Notion Calendar access to Notion by selectingAllow access. If the integration is successful, you’ll see it appear in your settings.
Note:
If you have multiple workspaces, you need to connect them individually to Notion Calendar, even if those workspaces are associated with the same email address.
A workspace admin can’t turn on Notion Calendar for everyone in their Notion workspace. Notion Calendar and Notion must be connected at the user level.
Don’t worry — connecting Notion Calendar and Notion doesn’t mean your company will have access to your calendars.
----
When you create an event in Notion Calendar, you’ll see aDocs and linksfield in the event. Click into this field to add a Notion page, like an agenda, to the event details. From here, you can:
Make a new Notion page by selectingCreate Notion page. Give your page a title and indicate where you want that page to live, and in which Notion workspace. SelectCreatewhen you’re done.
Choose an existing Notion page by searching for it, or selecting an option fromRecent Notion pages. You can also switch between Notion workspaces if you have more than one connected to Notion Calendar.
Once you attach a Notion page to an event, you’ll be able to access it quickly and easily before a meeting, both from inside Notion Calendar and your menu bar.
----
You might use Notion databases to track important deadlines or events in calendar or timeline view. You can bring these events directly into Notion Calendar so you can see all of these dates in one place! To add a Notion database:
At the bottom of the left sidebar of Notion Calendar, find the Notion workspace that contains the database you want to see in your calendar.
Hover over the calendar’s name, then select•••→Add Notion database. Search for and select the database you want to add to your calendar.
Dates from your database will appear in your calendar.
Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcutO, or entercmd+Kand type “show Notion database”.
----
You can also add a Notion database to Notion Calendar from inside Notion. When you open a database with a date property in Notion, you’ll see the option toOpen in Calendar.
Note:
You can only add a database while using Notion Calendar for desktop or web.
At the moment, you can only view your Notion database in Notion Calendar, not in Google Calendar.
You can add up to 10 databases to Notion Calendar.
While you can connect an existing Notion database to Notion Calendar, you can’t turn your Notion Calendar into a Notion database at this time.
Note:To edit Notion databases from Notion Calendar, you’ll need edit access for the database.
To create a new database entry from inside Notion Calendar:
Select an open time slot in your calendar.
----
In the right context panel, enter the details for your database entry.
Open the dropdown menu and select your Notion database.
Need to make adjustments to Notion database items from within Notion Calendar? To do so:
Select a database item.
In the right context panel, change the title, date, and time of your event. You can even move the item to another calendar.
These changes will all be reflected in the original database in Notion.
Note:
If the dates for a database you connect to Notion Calendar are generated using the Formula, Created time, or Last edited time properties, those dates will be read-only in Notion Calendar. In other words, you can’t edit those dates from inside your calendar.
----
If you duplicate a Notion database item in Notion Calendar, a new page will be created in your Notion database with the same title and date, but it won’t duplicate any other content inside the original page.
If you move a database item from one workspace to another inside of Notion Calendar, a new page will be created in the destination workspace with the same title and date. The original page will be archived in the source Notion workspace and can berestored.
----
If you want all new events you create in Notion Calendar to be added to your Notion database, change your default calendar to the database. To do this, go toSettings→Calendars→Default calendarand pick the database you want to set as your default. On desktop, you can also set a default calendar by clicking the square next to the database’s name in the left sidebar.
----
Your calendar events can be viewed and joined directly from inside Notion. In Notion, go toHomein your sidebar to view your Upcoming events widget. If you haven’t already used Notion Calendar with Notion, you’re logged out of Notion Calendar, or you’re using the widget in a new or different Notion workspace, you can selectConnect to Google Calendarin the widget to set up your calendar.
Note:If you’re using Notion for desktop, you may be prompted to sign into your Notion account on the web to set up the Upcoming events widget.
This widget can be customized to show the calendars and events that you want — learn more inthis article.
Note:
You can connect multiple Notion Calendar accounts to the Upcoming events widget in Home.
----
If you’re in multiple Notion workspaces, don’t worry — you can adjust your Upcoming events widget differently for each!
You can unlink Notion Calendar and Notion from inside either app.
In Notion Calendar, go toSettings→Notionand selectDisconnectbeside the workspace you want to unlink.
In Notion, go toSettings & members→My connections. Select•••besideNotion Calendar, thenDisconnect account.

Views, filters & sorts
There are six different ways to visualize your content within a database. Here's a high level overview of each layout:
Table:Tables allow you to see your database pages as rows, with every property represented by a column.
Board:This view groups your items by property. For example, you could use it as a Kanban board to move tasks from one status to another as you make progress on them.
Timeline:Use your database to plot project milestones on a timeline so you can see when they’re happening and how long they’ll take to complete.
Calendar:Calendar view displays your items based on theirDateproperty.
List:Lists are a very clean, minimal layout of your database items.
----
Gallery:This view is useful for highlighting images. You can edit your gallery to show images contained in theFiles & mediaproperty — otherwise, the gallery will show any content that the database page contains.
Chart:This view visualizes your database items in a bar, line, or donut chart so you can easily analyze and report on the data.
When you first create a database, you'll need to choose the layout of the default view. After this, you can create a new view by selecting+next to your existing views. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and selectAdd view.
You can also provide others with information by giving your view a description. To do this:
Select a view →Edit view.
----
Selectⓘnext to your view’s name, then enter your description.
When you hover over a view, you will see its description.
You can reorder your views by dragging them. If you have a lot of views, you can select{#} more...next to your views to do this.
In your sidebar, views show up as nested items inside any full-page database. You can tell they are views because they'll have a•to their left. Click on any view in your sidebar to jump right to it.
When you’re in a given view, click its name to rename, duplicate, delete, copy its link, or edit its components. You can also edit view components by clicking the•••at the top right of the database.
Each view of the database has several components that you can customize:
----
Layout:Choose how you want your database to be visually organized.
Properties:Show or hide database properties for each view.
Filters:Add criteria based on property values to show or hide data.
Sorts:Sort by a property to change the order that pages are displayed in.
Groups:Group your data by the values in a property.
You can copy an anchor link to this specific view of your database so you can share it elsewhere.
Click the•••icon at the top right of your table.
ClickCopy link to {view}and the URL will copy to your clipboard so you can paste it.
Within each view, you can choose how you'd like database pages to open. There are three options:
----
Side peek:Open pages on the right side of the database. The rest of the database view continues to be interactive on the left.
Center peek:Open pages in a focused, center modal.
Full page:Open pages as full pages directly.
To change the setting per view, click the ••• at the top right of your database, and open the Layout menu.
Scroll down and change theOpen pages insetting.
Note:Table, Board, List & Timeline layouts will open pages in side peek by default. Gallery & Calendar layouts will open pages in center peek by default.
Notion makes it easy to filter your database so it only displays the items that meet specified criteria, i.e. have (or don't have) certain properties. These filters can be as simple or complex as you like!
----
To filter the entries you see in a database view:
ClickFilterat the top of your database.
In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to filter by.
This filter will now show up at the top of your database. Click the filter icon to see and edit all of the filters that have been applied to your database.
Add another filter by clicking the filter icon. You can have as many filters as you'd like!
Note:In a shared database, any changes you make to filters and sorts in views won’t affect other people on the team until you clickSave for everyone.
You can create more specific database views and combineANDandORlogic by using filter groups. These can be nested up to three layers deep! Here's how:
----
Click the filter icon at the top of your database →Add advanced filter.
A new menu will pop up. Here, you can choose the properties that you'd like to filter by, and customize theANDandORlogic of the advanced filter.
In the example below, we're filtering the table view of our Roadmap so that all the entries have to meet the criteria that include bothANDandORlogic.
Tip: You can quickly turn a filter into a filter group by clicking the•••to the right of the filter, and selectingAdd to advanced filter.
You can sort your database so that items are displayed based on properties appearing in ascending or descending order.
For example, you can order them based on priority, or last edited, or alphabetically.
Click⇅at the top of your database.
----
In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to sort by.
This sort will now show up at the top of your database. Click to edit it.
You can add as many sorts as you want, or remove them by clicking theXto their right.
Change the order that multiple sorts are applied by dragging them up or down using⋮⋮.
Note:Different properties sort by different logic, depending on their value type.
Text properties such asNameandTextsort alphabetically.
Number properties sort numerically.
ForSelectandMulti-selectproperties, you get to define what sorting order means. Click on the property, then drag options up or down to set the sort order.
----
You can group your database by different properties on your table to visualize them in different ways.
Click the•••menu and findGroup. You can group by nearly any property type.
The database will now group by values of that property. Each group includesa👁️to the left, so you can quickly hide groups and focus on what you need.
You can sort your database groups by selectingSortand choosing to sort manually or sort by the options provided (alphabetical, ascending, and more).
Empty groups can also be hidden from view with theHide empty groupstoggle.
You can search for specific content in your database.
Click🔎at the top right and type the word(s) you're looking for in page titles or properties.
----
You'll see your database change in real-time to only show the items that fit that criteria.
If you have a large database, it's probably tedious to keep moving back and forth between properties to compare their data.
Instead you can freeze one column, which will cause it to stay visible on the left side no matter where you scroll in the database.
To freeze a column, click the name of the column and clickFreeze up to column.
To unfreeze a column, click the name of the column and clickUnfreeze column.
Database properties add all kinds of context to your database items, like due dates, task owners, relevant URLs, last edited timestamps, and more. Use these properties to filter, sort, and search your data 🧩

When you clip a web page into a database, a URL property will automatically be added to capture the address of the original page (even if there wasn't one before)!
You can also add tags, other properties, comments, and edits to the pages you clip. Here's what a clipped article looks like in a Notion database:
Our mobile Web Clipper uses native share sheet functionality on both iOS and Android.

Note:You'll need iOS version 13.0 or above to use Web Clipper on iPhone or iPad. For Android, you'll need version 7.0 or above.
Open Safari or Chrome on your device and tap theShareicon on any page you want to save. (It looks like a box with an upward arrow in the center.)
This will bring up your device's mobile share sheet. Scroll through the apps that appear to select••• More.
From that menu, turn on Notion access.
From now on, Notion will appear on your mobile share sheet.
Tap the Notion icon, title the page you're saving, choose which workspace and page you want to add it to, and tapSave.
Go to the page you chose to see your clipping, comment on it, add properties, etc.!

Create a title for the image, select the Notion workspace you want, and tapAdd toto choose the exact page/database you want to add the image to.
When you clip local files to a database, no URL will be added.
Note:Websites are built in all kinds of ways, so they can't all be parsed the same way. Formatting in Notion will vary. We've made sure clips from top sites like Pinterest, Netflix, Wikipedia, etc. look great, and we're always improving!
I tried using the web clipper on mobile, but got an error message This app is not supported.

Unfortunately, Notion Web Clipper only works for entire pages from your web browser, or photos from your photo roll. It doesn't support other apps yet, like the Twitter app or the iOS Notes app. Definitely possible in the future though!
I tried clipping a web page with the Web Clipper, but some of the page content is missing.
Oops, sorry about that 🙈 If you wouldn't mind sharing the URL with us atteam@makenotion.com, we'd be happy to flag to our engineering team so they can tweak the clipper accordingly.
Can you add tags to a web page while clipping it?
Not at the moment, unfortunately. Definitely possible for a future iteration though ✂️
----
For the time being, you'll need to open the clipped page in a Notion database to add and edit any tags or other database properties.
I installed the Safari extension, but am seeing long loading spinners when I try to use it.
Unfortunately, some Safari configurations seem to be causing performance issues across many different Safari extensions, including Notion's. To help our engineering team debug this issue with Apple, could you let us know:

What is a block?
When you create your first page in Notion and begin typing, you've started with a text block. But Notion pages can contain a lot more than plain text!
Imagine every piece of content you add to a page — whether it's text, an image, or a table — as a single building block. Every page is a stack of blocks combined however you want.
Here's just one example page with different block types pointed out:
Tip:Hit the/key on your keyboard (or tap the+button above your keyboard if you're on mobile) to see all the different types of content you can add.
Any block in Notion can be turned into any other type of block in order to use, view, or deepen that information in a new way.
----
Try this out by clicking the⋮⋮symbol and choosingTurn intoto convert your block to something else!
The⋮⋮button can be used to drag and drop existing blocks. This makes it simple to rearrange, reorder, and reshape your thoughts with one motion.
Every page you create in Notion is a fresh canvas where you can add whatever content you want. Follow these steps to create your first one 📄

What is a database?
Think of Notion databases as filing cabinets or notebooks. Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database "Docs."
This gives you a birds' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents.
But wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page.
----
To help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item.
You can then search, filter, and sort by these property values.
Databases in Notion are not static. The set of pages within each database can be displayed in many different forms, or what we call views.
In addition to table view, the contents of a database can be visualized as a list, board, calendar, gallery, or timeline - whatever makes the information the most useful.
Now we'll create a database and use it to show off essential database actions and features. You'll get to play with database properties, views, filters, and sorts - let's get into it 📈

Make it simple for people with certain email address domains to automatically join your workspace as members, or as workspace owners if you're on a Free plan. As soon as they sign up, Notion will recognize their email and ask if they want to join your workspace.
New allowed domains are restricted to the email domains of the members of that workspace. To add a domain that isn't available, someone with an email address from that domain will have to join the workspace.
Use this so all new employees who join your company can easily join your shared workspace. All they have to do is sign up for Notion with their work email.
Bear in mind that you'll be charged per member onPlus, Business andEnterprisePlans.

Depending on how you're using your workspace, you may want to keep the data you have in it private for just your team. If you have an Enterprise Plan, you can go to theSecuritysection to adjust two kinds of settings.
Note:Some of the following settings are available to Enterprise users only.
Allow members to request adding other members: This setting is available on all plans.
Allow any user to request to be added as a member of the workspace: This setting is available on all plans.
Allow page access requests from non-members: This setting is available to all plans except Enterprise.
Disable public sharing: Don't let memberspublish Notion Sites. Any Notion Sites already live on the web will be taken down.
----
Disable duplicating pages to other workspaces: Don't let members move pages to other workspaces. Especially helpful if you have a lot of people and a lot of pages. It can get confusing fast, and some people may lose access when pages get moved.
Disable export: Don't let members export pages. This ensures that all your data stays in Notion rather than having different versions saved as Markdown or CSV.
Disable members inviting guests to pages
Allow members to request adding guests(available if the above setting is turned on)

Your Notion data will always be backed up in the cloud, but you can also export it for safekeeping. You can export all your pages as HTML, Markdown, or CSV (for databases), along with any files you've uploaded, too.
If you're on a Business or Enterprise plan, you can also export your entire workspace to PDF, which can be helpful for legal and compliance backups.
----
Pages that the exporter doesn't have access to, such as private pages of other users, will not be included in the export. Workspace admins on the Enterprise plan can give themselves and others access to specific pages using content search, so that those pages can be included in future exports. Some content also may not be exported based on teamspace settings.
A sitemap (index.html) is included the export to help you navigate the exported workspace. The list items in the sitemap are locally linked to the exported pages in HTML and Markdown formats.
To export your workspace content:
Go toSettings & membersin your sidebar →Settings.
Find and selectExport all workspace content.
----
You'll receive an email from Notion with a link to download your files. This link will expire after 7 days.
Note:
You can only export your entire workspace on desktop or web.
You can’t instantly recreate your workspace by reuploading your exported workspace content.
If you have a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan, you can click theExport members as CSVbutton to quickly get a list of everyone in your workspace.
The exported CSV will include:

When I subscribe to a Plus Plan, does it cover all my workspaces?
----
Paid plans only apply to one workspace, and don't cover the whole account. Workspaces are completely separate, so you won't be able to link any content between them.
We recommend using the least number of workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized.

Hover over any block and use the⋮⋮icon that appears as a handle to drag it around.
Blue guides will appear to show you where it will go. (A good way to nest bullets and to-do's.)

Can I make Full width my default? Is there a way to set a default style for all pages?
Not yet, but a lot of users have asked for this! We're continuing to keep this in mind for future projects.
----
Can I justify text to be center aligned or right aligned?
Notion doesn't have any traditional alignment options at the moment, unfortunately 😕But you can still make this happen. Drag and drop an empty line into the column next to your text to align it to the right or left.
Is there a way to disable the menu that appears every time I type /?
There's no way to turn this off by default for now, but you can pressescas soon as it pops up in order to dismiss it.
How can I copy text from multiple blocks?
----
On desktop, click and drag from the left or right page margin to select an entire block of content, or multiple blocks at a time. Click & drag fromwithina block to select, cut, copy & paste partial text across paragraphs, bullet lists, callouts & more — without having to select each block in its entirety.
