Add and manage integrations
Note:On Enterprise Plans, the following can be restricted to workspace owners:
The ability toadd connections
The ability toinstall workspace-wide security and compliance integrations
Members can add connections to a workspace inSettings & members→My connections. Workspace owners can add connections to a workspace inSettings & members→Connections. Once a connection is added, it can be added to more pages.
Connections built with the API follow a similar permission system to the sharing permissions for Notion users. In order to use a connection in your workspace, you'll need to add it to the specific page where it will be active.
Navigate to a page and select•••at the top right.
----
At the bottom of the pop-up, clickAdd connections.
In the resulting pop-up, search for and select the connection you would like to add to this page. You'll only see connections that have been created for and associated with this workspace.
The connection will now appear in the•••menu for the page.
If you want to remove a connection from a page, hover over its name and then pressDisconnect.
Note:Workspace owners manage all connections in a workspace. For more info,click here.
In your left sidebar, navigate toSettings & membersand then theConnectionstab.
Here, you'll see two tabs,MembersandWorkspaces.
----
From theMemberstab, you can manage the integrations that members can access in the workspace. Specifically, you can limit integration access to an approved list of integrations, view who is using an internal integration and disconnect the use of any integration in the workspace.
Note: Only Enterprise Workspace Owners can limit integration access to an approved list of integrations.
From theWorkspacestab, you can install and manage Security & Compliance integrations for their entire Enterprise workspace.
Click the•••next to an connection to see additional options:
Retrieve an internal API token
Visit the developer's website or contact their support
View users with access to the connection
Disconnect the connection
----
Notion has partnered directly with several services (such asZapierandTypeform). You can add our partners' public connections to your workspace directly through their sites via OAuth.
Search forNotionin the partner platform's app menu and add it.
In the resulting authentication menu, you'll be asked by the partner connection to allow access your workspace. The access levels required by the connection will be specified.
Connections are workspace-specific! Click the workspace name at the top right to switch to another workspace if needed. Then, pressSelect pages.
Now, you'll see a list of all of the pages in the selected workspace. Choose the pages you would like the connection to be able to access, and then pressAllow access.
----
Once you've completed the authentication, you'll see this connection in your workspace'sSettings & membersmenu →Connections.
Click the•••menu next to the connection name to visit the developer's website, contact the developer's support team, or disconnect the connection from your workspace.
Tip:Want to see some partner integrations in action?Check out this guide →
Some partner platforms require an internal integration token in order to link to your workspace.
In this case, first follow these instructions to create a corresponding internal integration for your workspace.
Once you've created the internal integration, navigate toSettings & membersin your sidebar and then theConnectionstab.
----
Click the•••menu next to the existing connection that you'd like to link to a partner platform, and pressCopy internal integration token.
Paste this internal integration token into the corresponding field on the partner platform's set up form.
Note:Notion does not support troubleshooting for partner integrations. Please direct any feedback and questions to the respective partner's support team.
With Notion's API, you'll be able to create custom internal integrations. Some of our partners may also require an internal integration token in order to link their platform to your Notion workspace - below, we'll walk you through how to set this up 🏗️

Notion pricing
Billing, payment, and refunds
There are several ways users can interact with a Notion workspace:
Members:People in your company or organization who can create and edit Notion pages, but can’t change any settings. These are colleagues or people who you work with across a large portion of your workspace.
----
Guests:People external to your company or organization who can be invited to individual Notion pages, but not an entire workspace. These are people who aren’t part of your team that you may want to work on specific pages with.
Workspace owners:Admins who can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage other workspace owners, admins, members, and guests.
Membership admins (Enterprise plan only):People who can add or remove members from workspaces or groups. They don’t have access to workspace settings.
----
Note: Depending on how your workspace owner has adjusted your workspace’s security settings, members may or may not by able to request adding guests or members. Additionally, users may or may not be able to request to be added to a workspace as a member.
Members are individualsin your company or organization. These could be colleagues at the same organization or people who read, edit, and comment on a lot of the same pages in a workspace.
To manage your workspace members, go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan). Here, you’ll see:
A list of active members of your workspace.
What teamspaces and groups they belong to.
Each member’s role in the workspace.
----
Note:On paid plans, you'll be charged per member in your workspace. For more information on plans,go here →
With email
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
Go to theMemberstab.
SelectAdd membersand type the email address of the person you want to add. If you don't have invite access, you will instead have the option to request to add a member.
Select whether to add them as aWorkspace owner,Membership admin, orMemberfrom the dropdown, then pressInvite.
They'll receive an email with a link to sign in and join your workspace.
Using a link
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
Go to theMemberstab.
----
SelectCopy linkto copy the secret link to your clipboard, and share with anyone you’d like to invite to work with you.
When an invited user clicks on the secret link, they'll be able to join your workspace automatically as a paid member, without you having to add their email address manually.
If you don’t want to be able to invite people to your workspace with a link, turn off the toggle next toInvite link.
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
Go to theMemberstab.
Select the dropdown for a member’s role, then selectWorkspace owner,Membership admin, orMember.
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan).
Go to theMemberstab.
Depending on your plan:
----
Select the dropdown for a member’s role, then selectRemove from workspace.
Select•••next to a member, then selectRemove from workspace.
Workspace owners can also remove other workspace owners from the workspace.
Note:
When you remove a member from a workspace, that person will instantly lose access to the workspace, and pages from thePrivatesection of their left sidebar will be hidden from view. If you invite that member back to the workspace, their private pages will be unhidden.
If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership will be restored upon rejoining the workspace.
----
If you're using Notion at your company, you can make it easy for anyone to automatically join your workspace as a member when they sign in with their work email.
Go toSettings & members→Settings.
UnderAllowed email domains, enter any email domain that you want to grant access to automatically, like your company's email domain. You can add multiple allowed domains in this field, but you'll only be able to add domains that workspace members' accounts are under.
Now, whenever someone signs into Notion with an email that has one of those domains, they'll see the option to join your workspace during onboarding. If the user joins your workspace, they will become a member of your workspace and you will be billed accordingly.
----
Note:Unlike members,guests are free to invite to your workspace as long as you stay withinyour plan’s guest limit. If your workspace is above this limit, any new users that you share content with will be automatically added as members and not guests if they have the same organization email domain.
To ensure you’re adding users as guests and not members, you’ll need to remove existing guests so you’re below your limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers).
Guests are individualsexternal to your company or organizationwho you invite into your workspace on a page-by-page basis. For example, guests could be:
People who have a different organization email domain.
----
Contractors or interns who are working with you temporarily.
Clients who you want to provide feedback on your work.
Friends, family, or mentors that you want to have contribute to or review your work.
Guests have the same capabilities as members, except:
They can't be given workspace-wide access. They must be invited to individual pages in order to view them and their sub-pages.
They can't create new pages outside of the ones they have access to.
They can't be added to groups of members.
They can't adjust workspace settings or billing information.
They can't add new members to your workspace.
They can't add new integrations to your workspace.
On any page you want to share with a guest:
Go toShareat the top right.
----
Enter the email address of any guest you want to invite.
Select a level of access for that guest from the dropdown and pressInvite.
SelectSkip for nowto make sure you’re adding them as a guest and not a member.
They'll receive an email with a link to the page.
If they don't already use Notion, they can sign up to access your page.
Note:If you’re on an Enterprise plan and the owner has prevented members from inviting guests to pages, then any people you invite to a page will automatically be added as members. Before you selectInvitein the steps above, you can hover over your guest’s name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.
Allow and approve access requests from guests
----
To make it easier for you to add guests to your workspace, Notion also allows people outside of your workspace to request access to certain pages in your workspace. This feature is available and turned on by default for all plans except Enterprise.
If you’re on a Personal Pro, Plus, or Business plan and you want to turn this setting off:
OpenSettings & members→Security.
Toggle offAllow page access requests from non-members.
Free plans will not be able to turn this feature off.
Once the guest submits a request to access a page, a notification will be sent to the inbox of the page’s creator. The page creator can approve the request as well as adjust the level of access for that guest, or they can ignore the request.
----
Note:When you add someone to a page, they can automatically access all of its sub-pages by default. That being said, you can restrict or expand sub-page permissions!
Members of a workspace can request to add guests to it. This feature is available on Enterprise plans only, and only workspace owners can enable or disable it.
Enable guest requests
Go toSettings & members→Security.
Make sureDisable members inviting guests to pagesis turned on, then turn onAllow members to request adding guests. Workspace owners canDisable guestswithout removing existing guests from the workspace. They still have the option to remove all existing guests if desired.
----
Once this is turned on, members will have to submit a request before they can invite a guest. Workspace owners are exempt and can continue to invite guests directly.
Note:Allow members to request adding guestsis a workspace level setting, and will override the any teamspace level guest setting. This means if a teamspace allows guests, but the workspace has enabled guest requests, members will have to submit guest invite requests to add guests to pages in the teamspace.
Request to invite a guest
If you're a workspace owner,you caninvite guests directly.
If you're a member:
Navigate to the page you want to invite a guest to. Just like with regular sharing, you must have full access permissions on the page to request to invite a guest.
----
SelectShareand type the name of the guest you want to invite.
Select the role you want the guest to have.
SelectInvite.
A notification will be sent to your workspace owner about your request, along with the page, role and email of the guest you requested. You will also receive confirmation that your workspace owner has been notified.
Approve a guest
Guest invite requests must be approved on a per page, per guest basis.Only workspace owners can view and approve guest requests. Each request will have the email of the guest, the member who requested it, the role that was requested, and the name of the page.
----
A workspace owner can approve or reject a request to invite a guest directly from the notification they receive, or by going to by going toSettings & members→Members→Guestsand finding the requests at the top. Once a workspace owner responds to a request, the member who submitted will be notified of the decision.
Once you've added a guest to a page, you can always change their level of access later. To change a guest's access level:
Go toShareat the top right. You'll see the page's guests listed in the dropdown menu.
Click the menu to the right of a guest's name. Choose which level of access you want to grant that guest from the following options:
Full access:They can edit and share the page.
----
Can edit:They can edit the page's content, but they can't share the page. (This is not available for guests on the Free plan.)
Can edit content:This permission level is only found ondatabase pages. They can create and edit pages within the database. They can't change the structure of the database and its properties, views, sorts or filters.Learn more about databases here →
Can comment:They can only read and comment, not edit or share.
Can view:They can only view the content, and can't share it.
Remove:Revokes their access to the page.
You can see a list of all the guests in your workspace and the pages they each have access by going toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Guests.
----
Under your list of workspace members, find your list of guests.
To the right, you'll see how many pages each guest has been invited to. Click to see or hop to the pages they can access.
On any of these pages, you can edit their level of access or remove them.
Give any guest the ability to access your entire workspace by turning them into a member. On paid plans, you'll be charged for each additional member. To turn a guest into a member:
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Guests.
Check the box next to the guests you want to upgrade.
SelectUpgrade {#} guest(s) to member.
Once they become a member, you can find them in your member list and change their role.
----
On non-Enterprise plans, we’ll also suggest some guests who might benefit from becoming members in your workspace. To see who these guests are, go toSettings & members→Members→Suggestions. You can selectUpgradeto turn someone into a workspace member.
To remove a guest from your workspace:
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Guests.
Check the box next to the guests you want to remove from your workspace.
SelectRemove from workspace.
To remove a guest from specific pages, you’ll have to go to theSharemenu in each page andRemovethem there.
----
You can set varying and granular permissions for different groups and teams without having to divide your people into different workspaces! Instead, create groups inside one workspace and grant them different levels of access page by page. Here's how.
Note:Guests in your workspace can't be added to groups. This feature is for members only!
Workspace owners and membership admins can create and edit groups. To do this:
Go toSettings & members→PeopleorMembers(depending on your plan) →Groups.
SelectCreate a groupand enter a name for your group. To set an icon for the group, just click the emoji icon that appears on hover.
Toggle open your new group and selectAdd members.
Add as many members as you want to any group.
----
You can also clickRemoveto the right of any group member.
Select•••next to a group toRenameit,Create teamspace from group, orDeleteit.
You can always search someone's name or email to see which group they're in.
For any page, choose which groups can read, comment, edit, and share it. To share a page with a group:
ClickShare, thenInvite. You'll see all groups at the bottom of the pop-up.
Pick a group, then choose what type of access you'd like to give that group from the dropdown:
Full access:They can edit and share the page.

Can comment:They can only read and comment, not edit or share.
----
Can view:They can only read the content, and can't share it.
Remove:Revokes their access to the page.
Once a group has been added, you'll see it in theSharemenu, and you can adjust their access level in the drop-down.
You can give multiple groups access at any level on the same page.
Permissions on any page also apply to all of their sub-pages.
Teamspaces are a dedicated area for every team within your organization or company, and can be customized on an individual basis.Learn more about teamspaces →
To share a teamspace with groups in your workspace:
Hover over the name of the teamspace in your sidebar.
Click the•••button, thenTeamspace settings.
From here, you'll be able to search and add groups to the teamspace.
----
Is there a limit to how many guests I can add?
See the guest limit for your planhere →
If your workspace is above the guest limit for yourplan,new users that you share content with can only be added as a member (instead of as a guest) if they belong to your workspace's email domains. This could mean that they have anallowed email domainor an email domain matching the workspace owner’s domain or one of the workspace’sverified domains.
I clicked the Join or create workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?
----
You can only join a workspace via theJoin or create workspacebutton if that workspace has theAllowed Email Domainssetting enabled to allow users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.
Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.
How do I share with individuals and not whole groups?
You can share a private page with individual members of your workspace by clickingShareat the top right and thenInvite a Person. Search for their name, set a level of access for them and pressInvite.
You can also share a private page with a guest through the same mechanism, only you should type their email instead of searching their name and pressInvite.
Why do I need to disable workspace-level access?
----
You don't have to. Just know that whatever level of access is specified forEveryone at [workspace]is the lowest level of access for everyone in your workspace. If you want some pages to not be visible to certain people, then we recommend disabling it. You can always grant some groups or individuals more access.
Why are these pages in the Shared section of my left-hand sidebar?
Those are pages shared with only specific groups or individuals. They aren't visible to the rest of the people in your workspace. In order for pages shared with groups to show up in this part of your sidebar, you need to disableEveryone at [workspace]. Otherwise, everyone in your workspace will still see it.
----
As a quick refresher, any page in theWorkspacesection of your sidebar can be viewed in some respect by everyone in your workspace. Any page in thePrivatesection of your sidebar is for your eyes only.
How can groups be used instead of multiple separate workspaces?
We've seen people create multiple workspaces instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, and their executive team so these groups can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. There's a quick workaround for this using groups:
DisableWorkspace access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.
----
On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.
So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn onFull accessfor only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!
Can I create a shared private page using groups?
----
Yes. If you create a page in thePrivatesection of your sidebar, you can go toShareand toggle on access for a group inside your workspace. Choose their access level like you would on any other page. You'll see the page automatically move to theSharedsection of your sidebar. Only you and the members of that group will be able to see it.
How can I allow members in my workspace to request guests for approval?
As a workspace owner, you can disable guests for your workspace in yourworkspace security settings, but still allow members to send guest invite requests for review by the workspace owners. This provides a standardized way for guests to get access to content within your workspace, without being an all or nothing approach.
----
There's no limit on the number of people who can view and edit the same page or database at the same time. Your team can collaborate on shared content no matter where they are, what time it is, or what device they're using 💼

If your policy content lives in Notion, you can connect Notion with Drata to manage that content. Changes you make to policies in Notion will be synced with Drata.
Note:
For the best experience, try to avoid using database blocks in Notion pages that you sync with Drata.
You can’t sync any private Notion pages to Drata.
----
If a policy stored in Notion is deleted by a user, you’ll be prompted to import a new file in Drata.
To integrate Notion with Drata:

I just made updates to a page, but I didn't receive a Slack notification.
There's a five minute delay built in to prevent these notifications from getting too noisy!Let us knowif you still aren't seeing them show up! We'll help out.
I'm trying to enable the integration in Slack's App Directory, but it just takes me to Notion's homepage.
----
Sorry for the confusion 🙈You can't enable the integration from Slack. You'll need to turn it on inside Notion with the instructions on this page.
What permissions are granted when the Slack integration is enabled?
Notion's integration with Slack operates on a per-page basis. When you enable the Slack integration for a specific page in your Notion workspace, you're granting Notion access to publish updates to the Slack channel of your choosing.
Can I add more than one login for a link preview integration?
You can! You can do so viaSettings & Members→My connected apps. For the desired integration, select “Connect another account”.
----
Note: Some applications do not support multi-account login in the browser (e.g. GitHub), so you might need to logout of whichever account is currently logged in on your browser to be prompted to login with a different account.
We’ll determine which of your accounts to use to preview given resources and show an error if none of them are successful.
I’m receiving a general  “Can’t load preview” error in my link preview.
Run through these steps to try to resolve.
Confirm you’ve authenticated with the correct account for the resource.
Confirm no access restrictions for your organization.
----
Delete your integration in Notion via theMy connected appssettings. You may also want to revoke the integration the corresponding platform:GitHub,Jira,Slack,Asana,Trello.
Try to unfurl again.
Finally, if all else fails, reach out to support! Unfortunately, we cannot help resolve errors related toAccess deniedorContent not found.Please provide the following information when reaching out to support:
Integration you’re trying to use
Error message and code
URL you’re trying to preview (if possible)
I’m receiving an “Access denied” or “Content not found” error in my link preview.
There are two possible reasons for this:
----
You may not have authenticated with the account that has access. You can connect multiple accounts either throughSettings & Members→My connected apps, or the error drop down.
Your organization may have limited access to content via 3rd party integrations or IP addresses. Please confirm with your workspace or organization administrator and ask to have Notion’s integration approved if this is the case. Here are instructions for specific integrations:GitHub,Jira,Slack,Asana,Trello.
What do connections have access to in my workspace?
SIEM integrations will be authorized to receive event logs on all workspace activity.
DLP integrations will be authorized:
to receive event logs on all workspace activity.
----
to view content, view comments, edit content, edit comments, and create comments inallpages.
to see basic information about all workspace members and guests, including their names, profile images, and email addresses.
I’m not seeing SIEM events even after connecting. What should I do?
Sometimes, the event may appear under a different label or in a different place than where you expect. We recommend triggering a new page event and querying in your SIEM querying language fortype: "page.created"oremail: "[your email address]"for all events triggered by you.
When a new Pantherinstance is created, it can take up to 10 minutes for it to be fully ready to receive events.
What happens to my SIEM events if my SIEM provider has an outage?
----
In the event of an outage, you should reach out to your SIEM provider for more information.
Why can’t I connect more than one instance of the same SIEM provider?
SIEM provider can only be connected to a single Notion workspace at this time.
Having trouble setting up your SIEM connections? Here are some common issues.
Incorrect webhook URL
Incorrect HMAC or HEC token
Do not have admin privileges in your SIEM provider
SIEM provider is an on-prem instance
Enterprise workspace owners have control over when users’ pages are deleted from Trash, and how long they can be retained for afterwards 🗑️

Content search
As a workspace owner, you can selectSettings & membersin the sidebar and then scroll toContent search.
You’ll see a search bar with different filtering options. Search for a page by entering either the it's title, ID, or page content.
You’ll also see:
Where a page lives and whether a page isprivate, shared internally, shared externally, or shared to web.
The page creator, creation date and a list of people who can access the page.
Who last edited the page and when.
Workspace owners can also export this data as a .csv file.
Note:TheAudiencecolumn will always list the most permissive group. If a page is shared with another team member, but also shared externally, the audience will read:Shared externally.
----
There might be some cases where, as an admin, you need un-publish or revoke permissions. Try using theAudienceorShared withfilters to find pages that might be inappropriately shared. As a workspace owner, you can also change access to a restricted page.
Click the•••menu to the right of any page title, or while on a restricted page.
SelectChange permissions.
Change access as needed.
Note:Using this feature may provide workspace owners with access to the personal data of workspace members and guests. Please consult with your own legal counsel to obtain advice regarding privacy and data protection laws.
